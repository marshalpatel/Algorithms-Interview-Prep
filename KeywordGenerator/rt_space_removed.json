Won't be going back to this location again, and will definitely ask if there's a fee for refills if make it back to any of the other newly-renovated locations. For the prices, which granted is good consistent quality food, down't seem like too much to expect free refills."

It got a little bit more busy later but still surprisingly slow for a Friday, I thought.\nTheir saketinis are sooo yummy. First, I got the creamy peach and that was very tasty.. sweet but not too strong. My second drink was the Fuji Apple saketini and that was.. kind of strong and it didn't taste like Fuji apples.. my friend said they put apple puckers in there.. that was all I could taste pretty much. I tried my friend's mango chu-hi (a sochu drink) and it was good.. kind of weak, but she said there is mango puree in there. yum!\nFor appetizers:\n-Spicy Tuna Salad ($4.95 HH) Spicy tuna on top of spring lettuce, shredded cucumber and radish sprouts. Good stuff, but I just don't like the ground up spicy tuna.. I like them in chunks!\n-Sesame Chicken ($4.95 HH) \n-Salmon nigiri ($2.50 HH) \n-Vegad Roll ($5.95 HH)\n-Agedashi Tofu ($3.95 HH) \nThey still have reverse happy hour, I think starting at 9pm. It used to buy select items and regular price and get the second item (in the same category) for a $1 but I think they did away with this. \nOverall, their food and happy hour is good. I'd say regular price, they are kind of high. But that could be due to being located in a popular shopping center.. but who knows. Will be back :)"

Ask your empolyees again if I was told to bring $300 to $500 dollars in cash and whether you ever explained to me about a broken machine but rather just to bring cash. Now I was obviously drugged and mumbled from the time I walked in the shop so no one could understand me? That is blatantly slanderous. Rarely are heavily drugged people called rude so many times because they are not capable of being coherent enough to be rude.Such a poor attempt at your own defense. Say what you will but you know you have lied. I noticed all of your positive reviews are quite old. \" I refuse to write incorrect things about people who lie in the middle of the day.\" All I wanted was a rose.I was disappointed that I could not talk to the person ahead of time who you planned to do the tattoo. As I gave you a very detailed description of course I was disapppointed that I was explaining all of this to someone who knew he was not going to do the tattoo.I came in a day before I wanted the tattoo done as I politely explained on the phone so that it could be drawn on that day and inked on the next day. If no one was going to be available,it would have been a courtesy to tell me that. Fortunately there are many honest artists in town who won't call me rude, tell me I am on drugs, tell me they only take cash without an explanation,tell me to find an ATM to get $20 to hold an appointment, tell me they have never heard of a debit card when they obviously have, and then say I am on drugs. I remember too many things too clearly to have been drugged. I was disappointed by you not your employees and to them I apologize for this ugliness. You were unclear as to who you were among your employees and I only assumed you were the owner as you had the largest working space in the rear of the shop. Please ask your apprentice who could not keep up with the appointment book just how drugged I seemed as in your empty shop no one else could hear us.I apologize to the Las Vegas High School coaches who said you were a good guy and I should try going to you as you said you don't know any of them and had never heard of the school. They are very loyal gentleman and were hurt when they were told this as well as horrified to know they sent me to a person who called me rude and stated I was drugged the entire time in his shop. I doubt you need to worry about seeing them again but as you don't know them, it doesn't matter."

From the name, I guess I was just expecting a lot. \nLocation - located on a strip mall right next to a gas station and other food joints. Corner of Decatur and Sunset.\nAtmosphere - the place is small but it's pretty clean and cozy. It was pretty busy when I went during lunch hour. \nFood - I'm a nocturnal type of person so I always wake up late. I was craving some type of Mexican breakfast and I came across this place. I had the Chorizo breakfast burrito with a side of Barbacoa taco. Like I mentioned earlier, I thought the food was average. Prices are decent and it's something you'd expect from a place like this. I've had better ones at a local Roberto's ... \nService - no complaints on service. It's the typical order from the counter, pay and they'll being the food to you type of shindig. It was pretty prompt and the lady was quite nice. \nOverall, I'd probably give this place another go. Maybe for something quick or maybe to try their famous chocolate drizzled churro.

After doing some shopping at the Premium Outlets I decided to head over and check this place out since it was only about 10 min. away. \nI walked in around 5:30ish on a Friday and it was pretty empty, there were only about 2-3 other tables occupied. Score for me! I had my pick of tables and booths to choose from. I settled into my booth and tackled the menu, I thought it was nice that they had several tvs hanging around the restaurant which worked out great for folks like me who decided to dine alone :-)\nSo I got right to it, I ordered the 2 lbs of the king crab legs with the whole shabang medium sauce and the Cajun fries. I was going to order the catfish as well but thought that it would be way too much food for me. I was right the crab legs and fries were a perfect dinner for me! The whole shabang sauce that everyone raves about lived up to the hype! It was garlicky, spicy and delicious; I even dipped my fries in it! The fries were crispy and delicious and the Cajun seasoning had just the right amount of spice to them. Service was pretty standard not bad but not spectacular. All in all I was impressed with my first boiling crab experience, I will def. be sure to check out one of the locations in Cali :-)"

    "text": "The short: Reminds me of a lot of fun joints I've wandered into during Chicago vacations--sports memorabilia everywhere, TV tuned permanently to the current big game, bar-style seating arrangements. The staff is polite and laid back. The food (different styles of dogs, hot and cold subs, a few salads, and some gyros) is decent, a fair attempt at authentic, and more than anything, makes for a quick, cheap lunch. \nThe long: I first walked in here around 2007, attracted to the temporary canvas sign flapping in the breeze, advertising Chicago dogs. I walked into the ill-lit whole in the wall, had a dog and chips (I don't remember there being fries back then), ate, and walked out, thinking, \"What a bummer. Chicago would disown this supposed offspring if it ever caught wind of its hijinx.\" Over a year later, it sure has cleaned up nicely, upgrading from \"a dive\" to \"a joint.\" It's well lit, nicely decorated with Chicago-teams memorabilia (and stenciled t-shirts featuring SNL's Da SuperFans with one of their trademark quotes, \"Da Bears\"), a big flat-screen at the far end, and plenty of seats--a mix of high and low bar tables. The two guys working the counter were friendly and polite, as well as quick and efficient. My friend and I ordered Da Chicago hot dog (about $2.50), an Italian beef with sweet peppers (about $5.25, and you can get giardiniera instead), and a side of fries (about $1.75) to go. It wasn't exactly Al's Beef on Taylor, but it was a decent stand-in!\nDa Chicago hot dog had all the required fixings: deli mustard, unnaturally toxic-green relish, onions, pickle spears, a few tomato wedges, a couple of slightly hot sport peppers, and a dash of celery salt, all on top of a Vienna beef nestled into a poppy seed hot dog bun. The bun was MY only beef--it was a little firm and a bit chewy--maybe it was left out too long, which was odd, as I was the first customer of the day, righter it opened. The fries were fine--hot and soft and starchy on the inside, barely crisp on the outside, with just the perfect amount of salt (not too much, in other words). Nothing special, really. The Italian beef, the easiest to criticize, wasn't bad, either, though I wish I'd asked the counter guy if he could dip it (if I were eating in, I would've asked for it sopping). The bread roll was nice and chewy (almost too chewy--a real jaw workout), the meat was tender enough (though not truly memorable, and a little on the sparse side without inspiring a \"where's the beef?\" quip), the chopped sweet peppers were fine, and the gravy--well, it was wet and meaty. \nIt wasn't the most memorable food, but it was enough to spark some awesome nostalgia and make me want to head back to Chicago again. It's good for a quick lunch or dinner, for takeout or to stop in, especially if you want to watch the game (non-alcoholic style)."

Were we all just dying for a new place in CenPho or what?\nAnyways, we finally went to the Parlor which opened while we were off staying cool in Washington, and I feel like we are late to the party. Everyone has covered just about every aspect of this place.\nWalking up, you see the garden where they grow herbs, eggplant, tomatoes, peppers, and a few other goodies that they use for specials. Inside, the place has been renovated wonderfully and it is beautiful. The old 60's-style wall is really made into the centerpiece of the restaurant and I love everything about it.\nI tried the Watermelon Agua (vodka + watermelon juice) and it was amazing. Be had the eggplant bruschetta and it was a wonderful combination of sweet and tart. Brilliant! We also ordered a pepperoni pizza and a potato pizza. The pepperoni was by far the best because the meat was perfectly spicy and, I imagine, from Schreiners. Finally, we had some lemon pudding with raspberries with a ginger cookie. Strange combination but excellent.\nThe food was outstanding and our server was one of the best I've ever had. Can't say enough about how great this place is.

He is highly skilled in his craft, only to be pulled down by the sub par help who backs him up. Every experience with employees other than Steve has been dismal, and this review serves as a wake-up call to the management staff to better train their employees on service and skill.\nOf the many negative points I can make about the staff, my last experience left me questioning if I should ever return. While not in the mood for a specialty drink, I decided to order the French Press coffee which is highlighted as a menu item. After I purchased my coffee, I found a mug of drip coffee sitting on the bar. Assuming it was for someone else, I continued to wait for my French Press. Several minutes went by, and I inquired as to where my drink was, to which I was simply pointed to the cup sitting on the bar. I stated what was there was not French Press coffee, and in response I was told that their drip coffee IS French Press. Color me confused, but what was sitting on the bar was not what I had ordered, nor what I had paid a premium for.\nUnfortunately, banter back and forth with the staff led me nowhere but sitting at a table with my stale drip coffee, now only luke warm from sitting too long. Only able to tolerate a few sips, I left the mostly full cup of stale diner coffee questioning if I would ever return.\nSince then, there have been several occasions where I contemplated going back; however I have yet to convince myself of the benefit. \nUnfortunately this hidden gem of a coffee house has been tarnished by the service and lack of experience. Hopefully with time the talent will improve and better decisions will be made as to how to keep customers coming back."

It's still pricey, so this probably isn't the place to sate your random Thursday craving for sushi, but it is an excellent special occasion place for the sushi lover.\nUp a few flights of stairs in a minimalist environment, Umi serves up excellent sushi (and a really nice octopus salad), including some higher quality varieties you can't always find in the mid-range places--toro and uni spring to mind. This is not the kind of place you order chicken teriyaki (and if your date does order this, break up with him/her), Umi takes its suhsi seriously and the waitstaff is generally very helpful in navigating the menu, although I did have one experience there in which the waiter seemed like he was preening about his (legitimate) sushi knowledge.

The chips and salsa that are included with each order were very good, and so are the prices and their service. The place is new, so I'll have to give this place another go and see if they've got some of the kinks worked out."

The staff was friendly and informative on the specials. My hair stylist was Kerry and she did a great job. She really took her time with washing my hair, used deep conditioning and even did a mini scalp massage.... i loved it. I chose to do the mimosa blowout. Kerry made sure she understood and asked the right questions... how tight do you want curls? do you want lots of volume? She was professional and took her time with the blowout. She used rollers (i think) to help with the volume, and after she curled parts of my hair, she would clip it in a curl until all my hair was curled. Then she finished it out with styling product.\nI plan on coming back because they honor the groupon price and you don't have to buy it on groupon! Just tell them that you saw $15 groupon price and pay Iblowdry $15 instead of groupon. Overall, my friends and I were very satisfied with the stylists and our hair styles."

    "text": "We went on the 4th of July, before dinner at Chelsea's Kitchen. From the Chelsea's parking lot you can cut through the landscaping to the canal path; head west for about a quarter of a mile. There will be a paved section that breaks off the the right near some sort of sports field. Walk along the paved road which takes you right toward the tunnel that is the bats' abode and which is completely fenced off with black rod-iron fence. \nThere is no place convenient to sit while you wait patiently. As the sun begins to set, if you listen REALLY carefully, you can begin to hear the bats and, in our experience anyway, one or two will venture out at a time. It seems like they boomerang out and return to signal \"go time.\" \nI had expected a mass exodus of bats (even though Lisa O. specifically says \"don't expect a torrential outpouring\") after watching the famous bats of San Antonio and Carlsbad Caverns, so I was a little disappointed. Lisa O. is right: \"don't expect a torrential outpouring.\" \nBut, as we began to walk back to the restaurant, we could see so many bats dive-bombing the canal. Obviously, their dispersed exodus distracted me from how many I had actually seen leave the cave! \nI'd go again. Here are my tips: I suggest bringing lightweight folding chairs to get comfortable. Plan on getting there before sunset begins and staying until it's nearly dark. Maybe even bring a flashlight so you can light your return path. You can easily park your chairs on the paved section over the underpass (bat cave) while you wait for them to start doing their thing. If you hang out in the dirt area on the south side of the fencing the bats will rush past your head! It's hard to be quiet but I'd imagine it helps! We were clowning around giggling, shooting mock animal planet video commentary on our cell phone."

    "text": "I don't usually try dim sum places when I'm traveling unless I'm in a city with a big chinatown (LA, SF, NY). But it just so happened that China Chan is really close to my hotel. I decided to give it a try because of the reviews on Yelp! and I gotta hand it to you guys for being spot on.\nI was pretty worried when I pulled up to see that the building looked like something that used to be a fast food joint. I decided to go through with it anyways and when I walked in, I was greeted by a hostess in Cantonese. When you hear Cantonese at a dim sum restaurant that you're unsure about, it sounds a little bit like music in your ears. After we settled down and ordered our drinks, we started looking through the dim sum menu (this is one of those places that the carts don't come around... you order off a piece of paper and then everything is made to order...) and was SHOCKED to find that most of the items were priced at $1.80 per order. In my neck of the woods (Austin, Texas) most of these items are easily priced at $2.80-$3.00. So my buddy and I pretty much went nuts ordering. We ordered about 10 dishes (which is enough to feed 4 people) and our total bill was $23.00!!!\nGrowing up in HK, I've had my fair share of amazing dim sum. Even though China Chan's dim sum was not the same caliber to be compared to those of HK, I thought that overall most of the food was pretty solid (especially taking the price into consideration). There were some stuff (like the curry puff) that I thought could have been a little more warm when served. For the most part all of the dim sums that we ordered were spot on.\nThe service was great, but I couldn't give China Chan 5 stars because there were some misses here and there. Taking the price into consideration though, I'm not sure if Phoenix natives just don't know about this place or there're not a lot of dim sum fans here because we were the only table there the whole time we were there. I would highly recommend this place. In fact, I'm pretty serious about going back there tomorrow to get my dim sum fixing before I head back home."

He worked with my tiny budget (of a full-time student) and patched up parts when it was (possible and) too expensive to buy them new. If he ran into a problem, he would consult all of his sources from his East Coast upbringing and work on it until it was running perfectly."

I almost expect to open the door to my room and see Capitan Jack spring out from the closet and try to steal my hat, if I had a hat that is. \nWalking into the hotel I was surprised by the smell. And I do mean that in the nicest way possible. Most hotels have that clean but smoky smell to it (part of the Vegas charm I suppose), but TI has a nice flowery smell to it, and yes, good smells make me very happy. I have been to TI other than once or twice in the many many trips I've had in the past two years, so I didn't really know what to expect.\nThe room was a good size for four people. The bathroom counter had plenty of space for all sorts of toiletry items. The room had a more modern set up, dark wood and what not with lots of clean lines. The flat screen was a little on the smaller side, but since we weren't planning on spending most of our time in the room, it wasn't a big deal.\nCheryl Y. got a special rate for the room (her being a card member and all), so at the check-in desk they gave us a voucher for one of their bars for a \"buy on get on\" cocktail. Nice touch considering we didn't spend more than $90 per night.\nThe best part of staying at TI is that shopping is quite literally right next door. The Venetian shops are across the street, and the Fashion Mall is to the left, and Ceasers Palace is just a little past Mirage. Oh yes, the other awesome thing is Rhumbar at Mirage. It's like a FatTuesday, but wayyyy better. Well, at least in this yelpers mind it is.\nHad a great weekend with friends in Vegas at TI. The rooms were spacious, clean, and smelled incredible. What more could you ask for as you marinate your liver in alcohol?"

They did a fantastic job with the interior. It's perfect.\nAnd the waiter we had was very friendly and stopped by frequently.\nNow on to the points that need improving:\n-they were out of about six or seven items, including the salad dressing we wanted. The waiter told us they run out of the house specials early, but we were there at about 8:00 p.m.\n- the fried pickles weren't so great. There were two huge globbed-together mounds of them in the basket along with the loose ones.\n- the grilled cheese we ordered came out cold. They cheerfully took it back and comped us the replacement.\n- the veg burger... Is it the same as it was at the penguin? This one was kind of bland and just mushy inside. I remember liking the one at Penguin a lot more.\n- the salad (I know, I know, why get a salad at a place known for fried foods...) wasn't that great. It looked like it was thrown on the plate without thought. They would do well to jazz it up with some cheese or something (like at Pepper's in Chapel Hill, if anyone's familiar with that).\nThey're probably still ironing out a few glitches, so I expect they'll be running smoothly in the near future, but for now, as a paying customer, I didn't feel it was all that great, and certainly not worth waiting a half hour in line.\nBest of luck, Diamond! I can't wait to go back and hopefully have a five-star experience."

Also, the refrigerator was emitting an extremely foul stench. I cleaned out the damn appliance 3 times, let the darn thing air out and finally gave up and called the office. Took a few calls but after a few days got a new refrigerator. (Small victory)\nI would be willing to overlook the lack of parking spots after 8pm M-F, the abundance of stray cats, and even the weed smoking, 3am loud sex ghetto neighbors, were it not for the ROACHES! Yes, that's right, roaches! They did not appear immediately but a few months after I had moved in, which I found out from a neighbor that they too were plagued with these pests about a week or two after a downstairs apartment was bug bomed. (I guess they migrated to our apartements) I was not able to cook there anymore for fear of these nasty critters. The office did send pest control and I did see an improvement but they never followed up so I attempted to get rid of them myself, unsuccessfully of course. I will be moving out on 8/14 & and went to the office on Monday the 4th to personally deliver the last month's rent and to schedule the walkthrough which I've never done since this was my first apt. I was immediately informed at the office that I needed to purchase a money order and add a late fee of $75 even though they allow you to pay until the 3rd (which was a Sunday) or I could pay online for a fee of $30 + the late fee. Even though I've never been late in the past 11 months they still would not work with me even though I am unemployed due to being laid off. \nThere are probably a lot more things wrong with this place that I could list like the crazy lady the feeds the stray cats so that they will stay near her apartment, the rude black boy that works in the office but is only nice to women and promises things without checking first, the amount of simple repairs that are dismissed or forgotten.

They had an amazing selection of both mens, womens and kids flips and quite a variety of Reefs and Rainbows along with other names I can't remember. I told the girl what I was looking for and she pointed me in the right direction and what do you know, they had a big selection on sale marked 30 to 50% off so yeah, that was where I was looking. Soon enough, I found not one but two pairs of Reefs and was happily on my way to check out. \nThey have surf and skate apparel plus footwear and offer services such as waxing, maintenance and more for surf, skate and snow boards.

Always the first thing I do if I buy a car used. Plus, I had another mechanic give me the deets on her before her purchase... Let's just say I should have gone to James.\nThat morning, on the way to work, I lost all ability to move forward. Being on the highway helped (inertia, baby!) so I had a little time to move over, get down an exit, and eventually stop. Ugh.\nAAA. Tow truck. Car to Hondatronics while I go to work.\nAntsy and anxious, I kept calling but they hadn't had a chance to really go over her yet. The next morning, I got the call.\n\"Are you sitting down?\" \nYeah, that.\nIt was not good news. The clutch and flywheel required replacement. I have the photos. It's not pretty. \nI can't lie. I cried. I *just* bought this car.\nJames was, as I said at the beginning, AMAZING. He talked me through all my options, explained everything in detail about the parts and labor involved, and even gave me advice on buying the parts myself and having them shipped to him. Sure, it saves a few bucks... but then I have no warranties. We looked at everything. In the end, he did it all - parts and labor - blazing fast (we talked at 3ish in the afternoon... I had my car back by 11am the next day). They worked into the evening and did everything they could to make me as happy as they could in this situation. The education didn't stop there. He showed me the old parts, discussed with me the hows and whys of what we did. It still hurt the pocketbook - not his fault by any means - but my head and heart were good.\nTruly, truly, unlike any other shop I have ever been to. And, as long as he will have me as a customer, the only one I will go to here in Vegas."

The hostess gave us a 45-minute wait time, which we gladly accepted. \nOne peculiar thing about Ha Long Bay is the lack of a bar or other space to enjoy drinks and appetizers while waiting for a table. The hostess counter doubles as the cashier station for the dine-in guests and steady supply of carryout customers. Had we been offered a drink, we would have gladly ordered a round to help pass the time. The interior is spacious, yet cozy, and could quite easily be modified to clean up the crowded waiting area. \nAs our 45-minute mark approached, there were still several people who had arrived before us that had not been seated. A table for eight was reserved and left open the entire time we were waiting, and the group actually arrived around 8:15. As it turned out, my wife knew a member of that party and they had two unfilled seats, so they were nice enough to invite us to join them. Otherwise, it might have been another 15-20 minutes before we were at a table of our own. \nAfter sitting with our group, service was cordial and steady, but definitely with room for improvement. We each ordered Thai Iced Teas, along with the Pan-Fried Chicken Dumplings (six per order) and the Chicken Satay (four skewers per order) as appetizers. Both dishes were flavorful and cooked perfectly, with the appropriate garnishes. \nThe menu here is huge, and covers at least three different asian cuisines extensively. For our entrees, we tried the Panang Chicken Curry and Xao Tham (a ginger chicken dish). The portions for both were huge, the Xao Tham could easily have been shared by two people, and the Panang was also very hearty. In terms of spiciness, the curry could have been ordered at least one notch higher (I ordered medium, but it was very tame). Like our appetizers, both entrees were cooked perfectly and comprised of high quality ingredients. \nThe other members of our party had a variety of different entrees (Laab, Red Curry, Green Curry) and everyone was very satisfied with their selection. \nThe waitress had no issue giving us separate checks upon request, and our bill for two (two appetizers, two entrees, two Thai Iced Teas) was just under $40 before tip. \nLong wait times seem to be consistent regardless of time of day/week, so plan on a two-hour experience from walk in through walk out, and possibly longer for a larger group. Put simply, go here with people you enjoy killing time with. \nHa Long Bay could make the leap from 4.25 out of 5.0 to 4.5 or even 4.75 with relative ease by sorting out the waiting area, adding a bar, and finding ways to make service easier on their own staff. The food is on the same level as Lotus of Siam in Las Vegas. We will definitely be back often, as this is easily the best Asian restaurant we've been to over our 12 years in Madison. \nYelp Scorecard\nFood: 5 \nService: 2.75 (the chaos up front really hurts them in this area)\nCost: 5\nDecor: 3.5\nOverall: 4.25\nZagat Scorecard\nFood: 25\nService: 15\nCost: 28\nDecor: 20\nOverall: 22"

I ordered one of their lunch specials for my entree which was a burrito with red sauce, chicken and it came with rice and beans. I was expecting it to take a while for our food since it was so crowded but it didnt really take that long. I would prob go back and try some other stuff."

I walked in for a smoothie and walked out addicted to the acia bowls! A tasty blend of fruit, acai sorbet, honey, granola, pea protein and even veggies blended into sweet perfection! The bowls are huge and are definitely sharable, perhaps a bit smaller when taken to go. They are made fresh so it does take a bit of time, if you're in a hurry you can call your order in ahead of time. My princess and I love the chocolate coconut(made with cocoa flavored pea protein) & the peanut butter bowl(made with cashew butter). The Green bowl is a sweet surprise with fruit and spinach. We've had the cherry& mango smoothies, so yummy! Our punch card is over half way full, after 10 punches you receive a free medium bowl. Thrive is a fruit filled blend of guilt free perfection!"

And the beds are great.\nTo good news ends there.\nThis Westin's service is horrendous--from Direct of Operations, Brian Dell'Ergo (who I'm sure sets the tone) on down.\nWhen the front desk manager hands you a room key that fails to open your door after a late check-in, you tell yourself it's just a fluke. When you run down to the lounge to grab breakfast prior to your 9am meeting and the pans are stuck with leftovers from the night before, you might be frustrated, but you tell yourself this kind of thing happens from time to time.\nOver a two month period, I stayed at this Westin five times. Looking back, I struggle to understand how this hotel has permission to carry the Westin (and Starwood) name.\nAdmittedly, the hotel beds are comfortable and its rooms are spacious. That doesn't mean much, though, when you end up with scabies all over your legs, chest, and arms.\nThe crusted scabs between my fingers were probably most disgusting. It took over three weeks for the red bites and itching to go away after taking the prescription medication my doctor provided.\nWhen the front desk billed the wrong credit card to settle charges at the end of the week, I contacted the billing department. I left a few messages with the billing/accounts manager. He promptly returned my first call, but hasn't returned a single call since.\nYes, this hotel is beautiful. But the service is downright horrendous. I, for one, am not willing to get another round of scabies. I like to eat in the morning. I want my room key to open my door after a long day. And I can't afford billing errors.\nAs a result, I will not be going back to this \"Westin.\" And I most certainly will do a better job researching hotels on an individual basis.\nThis hotel cannot be trusted."

All of the other patrons sitting at the bar dressed likewise, the Vegas rocker punk demographic. \nWe got the porcupine shrimp appetizer, which tasted very similar to Chinese honey walnut shrimp. It was a really small portion for $11.

    "text": "Enjoyed a lovely dinner at RnW last night. I expected it to be fun from the names of the menu items I previewed online---I like humor---and it was very popular! We had to park waaay out! Fortunately, our party of six had a reservation. The ambiance is very cool and urban chic/hip and I loved the lighting installation when you first come in the door, with the lamps and strings of chains and beads. Nice lighting, music pitched so you could comfortably converse, and I have tot tell you---some of the most comfy dining chairs my tushie has enjoyed in a while---which is good, as we were there almost three hours!\nWine: I ordered the Meiomi Pinot Noir and it was excellent. Very smooth and fruity with a lovely finish. DH had the Sterling Merlot, which he was very familiar with and likes very much. I am not sure what everyone else enjoyed, but one member of our party prefers a sweeter more mellow wine and she wasn't pleased with her original choice. Our server gladly brought out small tastings until she found a tipple that was just right---I believe it was a zin. That small attention is what makes a restaurant very good!\nI started with the Pesto Caesar salad, which was quite good, but nothing out of the box. It was fresh and crisp and the plate was nicely chilled. I think everyone in our party chose that as their starter, except for DH, who chose the Calistoga House Salad. He was disappointed because there was a generous amount of goat cheese tossed thru it and felt they should have mentioned that on the description. They did: sweetie, Chevre IS goat cheese. Silly boy! He should have traded with me---I love Chevre!\nThe special that night was a surf and turf---I believe it was a marinated flat iron steak with shrimp. Four of our party ordered that. DH ordered the Chimichurri flat iron steak and I ordered the \"Southern Man\" Shrimp and Grits. Everyone was very happy with their meals, as evidenced by the all the new members of the \"clean plate club\"! My shrimp were very nicely seasoned and beautifully cooked. As my food cooled, my grits did become a little glue-y, but that was because of the generous amount of parmesan that had been stirred through-out, and if I would eat more than I talked, it probably wouldn't have happened. \nI was kind of disappointed to miss out on choosing between the zeppoles or brulee for dessert, but we were all so sated and happy! (We had also discussed walking over to a nearby shop that purportedly offers some of the best gelato in Scottsdale, but the combo of full tummies and nippy air.... Next time!)\nIt was a lovely meal in a handsome atmosphere and the service was excellent (and as usual, during the meal some of our party traded seats, a circumstance the waitstaff handled with aplomb as they were trying to serve us!) and DH said he saw at least three or four other menu items he would like to try on future visits. Once it's a little warmer, I'd love to dine out on the patio, which was beautiful---or at least enjoy a cocktail or two!\nNow, if I could just get that Neil Young earworm out of my head....."

I also appreciate the variety of sandwiches and toppings.\nHowever, there are three problems with this place:\n1) Quality of ingredients: It's just not where it needs to be to produce a great sandwich. The meats, cheeses, and the bread aren't terrible, but they're also not substantially better than subway. And that's not good enough.\n2) The speed. The employees are well-trained and courteous, but they just don't make sandwiches quickly enough. Given the size of their menu, I wouldn't expect Jimmy Johns or Potbelly-level speed, but in my two visits (both when there were very few customers there), I've been surprised at how long it took for my order to get out.\n3) The price. Given that the sandwiches aren't all that great, the price is simply too high. I got a 14\" Italian grinder where the only upgrade was extra cheese. It came to just over $13. Admittedly, the sandwich was enormous, but almost a dollar an inch for your largest sub seems like too much to be asking.\nI'll probably go back to Which 'Wich, since it's really close to my place, but I'm not thrilled about the idea."

It's definitely out of the way, in an odd part of downtown Phoenix, and the wait can be pretty gnarly - I recommend packing provisions, in case the wait is unbearable... \nPrior to eating here, I'd read raves and reviews of this bastion of thin crust pizza in Saveur and Gourmet Magazine. The proprietor is kind of a lunatic - he makes his own sausage... but I like that kind of fanatacism. He kind of reminds me of the Soup Nazi... and having eaten the crab bisque there at least a dozen times... Seinfeld DOWNPLAYED the vibe. It is what it is.\nOnce we found the place, (there was a lot of construction and accessibility was kind of wonky) we waited for about 45 minutes... they do have candle lit tables and wine service while you salivate, waiting patiently for a table to become available. This restaurant is definitely part of the \"slow food movement\" - the salads are incredibly fresh and crisp, and the pizza... definitely worth the wait. Obviously, you want to implement some \"strategery\" and arrive early, so as not to get stuck in the queue. \nIf you want the equivalent of pizza from the Gap, then by all means, call up one of those places that keeps their product under heat lamps and guarantees delivery in 30 minutes or it's free. But if you're looking for the Savile Row version of pizza, this is where you need to be. \nThe pizza arrives, toothsome and crisp, direct from their wood burning oven, made to order... bubbled and complete with a perfectly juuuuuust charred crust This is the kind of mad genius that is essentially non-negotiable, because it's so eye-rollingly delicious. \nGet your headspace right - this is an experience, not a standard reservation. Go early, have a glass of wine, be in the moment: revel in the comfortably arid dusk, and just enjoy it."

I introducted myself as a first-timer and was taken very good care of as I vascillated back and forth trying to make a decision as to what to order on this first reconnaissance mission.\nI finally ordered a gyro sandwhich AND a falafel salad as I was taking the food home and figured I could pass off the leftovers to my hubby that evening. The food did not disappoint. As others have stated, the gyro was STUFFED and overflowing with well-seasoned tasty meat. The sauce was delicious. I will not hesitated to order it again. The falafel salad was also scrumptious with 5 generous sized falafel balls on top of a salad with peppers, cucumbers and tomatoes. I particularly enjoyed the dressing and the fact that the salad was chopped into small easy to manage pieces -- yes I'm a diva about such things.\nOverall yummy food...more than generous portions...friendly staff.

The chicken was perfect: super moist and perfectly seasoned. The whole sandwich was sort of a piece of art. It's clear that whoever is in the kitchen takes pride in their work and has the chops of a chef and not a line cook. The interior was also very comfortable and a huge upgrade from the previous business.\nAll that being said, I was in complete disbelief at the pricing. I won't say that the food wasn't worth it, but in this neighborhood, at that location, in this town, I don't see this working. My chicken sandwich was just about the least expensive item on the menu at $13. Most of the entrees were $16-25 and I think dessert (also amazing) was $8 or $9. I had my two sons along and they actually had two items available in a children's section. They both got the salchipapas (hot dog and fries) for $8. To be fair, they did serve a really nice squash soup to each of us included with our entrees.\nI'm not sure who's behind the business side of the restaurant, but I have a feeling they have some restaurant experience in a big city. They seem a little out of touch with the Madison scene. Most places with really good food have sandwiches available in the $8-10 range with entrees in the $9-13 range. You really need to venture downtown to start pushing these kind of prices and you need to have a location that isn't a rundown, nondescript, white house.\nI don't think there's any way this model is going to work at this location. Besides one couple at the end of our stay, we were the only diners between 5:45-6:45 on a Friday night. I do think a restaurant (and even a Peruvian restaurant) could be successful here, but it's going to need to be able to serve it's surrounding neighborhoods. The people around here just aren't gonna opt for these prices, regardless of the food quality. Bring your prices down to match what's available on Atwood and think about the lunch crowd too. Reasonably priced sandwiches to go would have a strong market at that location. I really want to support you guys and this should be a regular joint for my family of four, but at these prices, it ain't happenin'."

There are so many different maps from hand maps, globes and even laminated wall maps. They have everything from all the states in the US to Chile, Athens, Malaysia, Sicily and much much more. Despite the easy access to GPS systems, smart phones and Google maps, there are many that still cling on to the original navigation system of eyes, maps and a good sense of direction. My dad still whips out his 6 ft map and lays it out on the living room floor when he is in search of an address (yet he has an iPhone, but I digress). If you're one of these rare creatures, the \"map readers,\" this place probably has any map you desire! Me, on the hand....you can give me a map and I have a pair of eyes to see it, but there is really no synergy between the two. Nonetheless, what an interesting store!"

I traveled to the Phoenix area this spring for vacation and finding Green was like finding an oasis in the Arizona desert. My dining experience here was the best I had on the trip and I know if I lived in the area I'd be eating here at least once a week. \nOne of the things that impressed me so much was that Green makes all of their vegan mock meat and cheese goodies from scratch. The No-Harm Chicken Parm Sandwich stole the show, and was not made with your standard morningstar chik patty but rather a seitan-based lightly breaded from scratch recipe. The fake mozzarella cheese (which seemed more like ricotta) was creamy and delicious. \nThe vegan chili on the fries was tangy with just a little spice, and my boyfriend's Argenitine po-boy was a good take on fake steak. The sides of tahini coleslaw and curry pasta salad were quite tasty as well. I only wish I'd had room to enjoy an oatmeal pie or a \"Tsoynami\" for dessert. \nThe service at Green was very friendly and it has a nice but casual artsy decor. I can't wait until my next trip to Phoenix!"

    "text": "Even though I'm not a pinball nerd by any stretch of the imagination, this place is definitely nirvana for those into waxing nostalgic with this old-school form of entertainment. According to the owner, he has a warehouse full of vintage pinball machines that are rotated out every couple of months to give them some good use. \nI'm not entirely familiar with many of the classic machines, but this place has just about every awesome one you can think of. KISS, A Nightmare on Elm St., Dracula, Guns N' Roses, classic pinball machines from the 40's/50's/60's... you name it, they probably have it. They've got one of 2 machines made for the difficult-as-hell Circus, a three-level game which requires great skill to get anywhere. They also have Revenge From Mars, the game intended to reinvigorate the world of pinball back in 2000. \nThe place is kinda dingy, though that adds to the charm more than anything. Still, I'd love to see these machines housed in a properly air-conditioned, state of the art facility. The air conditioning as of right now consists of some box fans from Target hung from the ceiling using plastic ties in front of an open air pipe. Obviously, a new system is in need. As an added retro bonus, check out the merchandise case. Some interesting items lurk in there... Bottom line: this is an awesome place to kill an hour or two."

    "text": "anyone that knows me know's that I'm not shy around guns, and lately I've been wanting to get back into the shooting hobby. since the economy is hurting and we just bought a house it couldn't come at a worse time. Fortunately full service ranges like shooters world offer affordable rentals. I rented a Sig Sauer P226 9x19mm parabellum. The gun performed amazingly 150 rounds downrange and only 1 malfunction which was easily cleared. \nI can't quite say the same for my Wife, she wasn't sure which handgun to rent, so I suggested she rent the Sig Sauer Mosquito chambered in 22LR, which I'd been considering purchasing myself as an inexpensive target shooter. she's not terribly versed with guns, but she's shot in the past in the desert and performed quite well despite inexperience, and did so as well tonight. Unfortunately the Mosquito has a bit of a strong recoil spring, and with all rentals per their policy require you to use their ammunition. unfortunately the 22LR rounds they offer don't seem to have quite enough kick to complete the cycle of ejecting the spent round and loading the next. Almost every other round I had to assist her in clearing the weapon. Failure to Feed, Failure to Eject, Double Feeds, Stovepipes, you name it. Luckily one of the friendly female range officers noticed her plight tried to assist, and when I showed her what was happening and offered to exchange the rental free of charge. After that she got a ruger mark II and had a fairly error free experience the rest of the time.\nThe highlight of the outing was when my Father-in-law accidentally walked out of the shooting bay with his unloaded GSG5 rifle. and when one of the range officers noticed him and warned him. And then when he did it again and was asked to leave the range area by the range master.to be fair he was trying to teach his wife who had never shot a round in her life how to shoot, and may have been a bit distracted. \nAlthough I'm sure it was upsetting to him, after having been formally trained by law enforcement professionals in my brief law enforcement career several years ago. He violated safety protocols and rules set forth by the facility. I also got warned once when placing the unloaded, slide locked back P226 back into the rental bag, the bag was about 6 inches sticking out of the back of the shooting bay. I was warned but more politely reminded than a dressing down, and they merely recommended that in the future I bring the bag to the shooting bench for safety reasons.\nI know beyond a doubt that I can handle a firearm safely, but I have to understand the view of the range officer in that they don't know how versed or experienced you are so it's necessary to treat everyone as a novice to ensure a safe and fun shooting experience for everyone. though I could see it as being offputting to someone that doesn't realize why.\nAll in all it was a very fun experience, the Sales staff was helpful in letting me see and handle a number of firearms when I arrived before the rest of my party. and the range was nice for a pistol range. It's also less than 2 miles from my workplace so I could definitely see stopping by here for an hour after a bad day.\nOh and I almost forgot the clerk forgot somehow I didn't get charged for my rangetime and I still have 2 1 hour rangepasses, so I may be stopping by sooner than you think. I know it's not something to rate a business on, but I doubt it ever upsets the customer."

The employees we have interacted with have always been very friendly and have a good sense of humor. We actually have the Blockbuster online thing (think Netflix) and it works fantastically. Whenever we come here to use one of our in-store exchanges, we are always in and out of there very quickly. The other location seemed to have difficulties with that. Anyway, this is my favorite Blockbuster in the valley. The two reasons I subtracted one star is the awful parking lot, and I wish it were a bit closer to my house."

Fast forward 2 weeks later, I'm back in Vegas, and my friends choose this spot for lunch. The restaurant is cute, no doubt. Fun decor. \nI'm giving this place 3 stars because we had an okay experience. The restaurant wasn't that packed while we were having lunch, but everything took forever. It took forever to order, to get our drinks, to get our food, and to pay. Also, our server never brought us silverware, so it wasn't until we all had our food sitting in front of us for a couple of minutes that we finally got some forks and what not.\nI ordered the Oriental Chicken Salad - not a bad salad, but not great. For $15, it definitely wasn't the best salad I've had. I also ordered a Mimosa during lunch, which I liked. I liked that they not only brought the champagne glass, but also brought the remaining amount of champagne in the champagne bottle. fancy&cute!\noverall, the experience here was okay... slow service, pricey food. it looks like from other reviews that the desserts are good. maybe ill come back to try it, or maybe ill come back if friends want to. other than that, it wasn't anything too crazy memorable."

    "text": "It had been a few years since I last gave this place a try. It hadn't blown me away as I had remembered, but I was still up to giving it another shot. I must say that this place is much better than I had remembered. I stopped in for lunch and there were several people eating in there at the time. I ordered the Luncheon Special #3 (Cashew Chicken served with an egg roll, fried wonton, fried rice, and a fortune cookie) for myself and a #1 special (Qwik special chicken which also came with all the additional stuff mentioned above) for a friend to go. Each dish was only $6.25 a piece and were both ready in about 7 minutes. I guess the Qwik part wasn't just a clever name, they actually do cook stuff up pretty fast there. I brought the food back to the office and tried my lunch. Yes, I also made sure to give my friend his lunch as well. It was a dark meat chicken, white meat can be substituted, in your typical brown sauce with veggies and cashews. However it was done well. No one ingredient dominated the dish and there wasn't a ton of sauce. The egg roll was crispy and flaky and filled with veggie goodness as well. I like the fact that they will deliver as far south as Camelback, north to Cactus, east to 60th street, and west to 96th. They are open until 9:30 pm seven days a week which is nice as well. I went back to try some of the soups and the dumplings and I have to say that while the soup was good, the dumplings may just be in the top 3 that I have had in Arizona. They don't have that \"just unfrozen\" taste that many restaurants have. I think I would have given them that fifth star had they had both scallion pancakes and noodles w/ sesame sauce on their menu, but alas they do not. I look forward to going back and trying many of their other dishes."

I've never been disappointed with their food, even after having eaten their food at least 100 times.\nI usually try to broaden out from my favorite menu items, but I find myself gravitating back to them. The lettuce wraps are VERY underrated and you get enough in one order to eat as a meal for one or two people. You get a big container filled with whole lettuce leaves and a giant bowl containing a mix of grilled meat, crunchy veggies, and little noodles. It's actually quite sweet and that pairs well with the taste and freshness of the lettuce leaves.\nBroccoli beef is always just the right amount of sweet, salty, and savory. It's one of my all-time stand-bys.\nThe honey-garlic chicken is flat-out amazing - my girlfriend orders it every single time we go. It's a tangy, sweet, and ooey-gooey dish.\nBut the best two things on their menu, by far, are the crab wontons and steamed dumplings. You owe it to yourself to try these, as well as the lettuce wraps.\nOverall, it's one of my favorite places to eat, anywhere. And since I don't live in Scottsdale currently (coming back soon), it saddens me to see the locals where I live think the mediocre Chinese food they eat is any good. When I come for visits, I now bring my friends to China Wok with me and they finally understand how good Chinese food can be."

You can make your pizza exactly as your heart desires. You choose all your ingredients and they bake the pizza for you. As far as I recall, no matter what you add, price doesn't change. Lately I've actually been getting less ingredients because it is a lot of food for one sitting. Crust is really thin. Sometimes it gets a little burnt but for the most part they got it right the dozen or so times I've been here. Management even bent over backwards a few times I've been here when a coworker's pizza didn't come out exactly the way they ordered it. The idea is pretty damn good and I would be very surprised if they don't open more locations in the near future. Located in the Raintree Ranch mall at the southeast corner of Ray and North Price Road in a clusterfork of a mall designed by dyslexic insomniacs on peyote. I've been to the same location once before in it's previous life as Luke's Of Chicago with the same bunch of coworkers who all decided that the food was pretty much meh except for their onion rings - which were awesome. Unfortunately onion rings alone couldn't keep the place in business - but that's actually a win for the rest of us as well as for the folks who work at that Fired Pie location. :)"

I guess with the peach, it still stays peachy sweet. The steak was very tender and moist and the peach chutney on top of it was a great combo, but it wasn't what I was expecting, was wanting more savory then sweet. \nI then ordered the braised steak with slaw and tomatillo avocado sauce, that right there was some good stuff! Moist, tender, flavorful, just a happy blend of happiness! (I ordered 2 of these!)\nNow I am a meat eater and normally leave the veggie dishes for them vegetarians but I was hearing this buzz among the people there that the portabella taco was the best, and I thought um what do they know, beef is always better.

Unfortunately, that place kept going down hill in terms of service and their prices climbed at the same time. Hence, back to my old standby, GV Hand Car wash. While this place is out of the way for me, it is worth the extra ten minute drive because of the quality job they do in washing my car. First off, it surprises me the lack of regular full service car washes there are in this town and the number of mobile auto-detailers. I guess the latter are just filling the void. Anyway, I digress. Here are the reasons I enjoy GVHCW so much:\n-Fair prices (a great bargain if you go to there website and print out a coupon) \n-Quality service\n-Detail oriented \nMy only issue is that it does take awhile. However, they do take there time when drying your car to make sure everything is clean and wiped down properly. When I go here, I know that I am not going to be in and out quick, but it is for good reason. To all the people that complain on here about there slow service, there are a good number of quick car washes out there that do a half-ass job but get you out quickly."

Perfect, crispy texture. The curry sauce was very hearty and even included a piece of meat!\nThen, our entrees came.\nThe Ginger Scallion Duck turned out okay. The sauce tasted a little weird and didn't complement the duck very well. We ate a few pieces and just lost our appetite for it.\nThe Malaysia Buddha vegetable stir-fry seemed to have been just thrown together haphazardly with some hoisin sauce and vinegar.\nWe weren't impressed by the coconut rice either. The rice was mushy and came with a weird stringy substance.\nOur total meal came out to $30 including tip/tax. We definitely did not feel like we got our money's worth. Maybe it would've been safer to just stick with the curries."

By 6:00 PM I was still waiting. No one even acknowledged me. At 6:01 another couple arrived to sit in the dining room.. This was when the same gentleman that seated me said he would be with me in another minute. I gave up and left. The sad part is, I only live one block away and I liked their sushi. It was disappointing that their disregard for their customers was so apparent. This was a second chance for them due to the last time I was there to get sushi and the health department had to shut their doors for three days. I will never be back. I would suggest anyone wanting sushi to avoid this place at all costs. They seem to have an issue when it comes to people of color."

I found this place by accident as I was just lost basically trying to find 485 outer loop.\nIn the hopeless traffic of Independence I saw this place witch has a huge parking lot, attentive waiters and waitresses as weill food that you can pack and reheat the next day.\nThe selection of seafood is second to none as you several selections of southern style (fried) seafood, grilled seafood (lots of choices), and even lobster available anytime. The one thing I love the most is the size of the entrees as they are huge. The salads are huge as well. The waiters give free hushpuppies and they have hot sauce available for those of us who like fiery seafood. The waitresses are nice and attentive openly giving your not just a glass but also two glases of your chosen beverage."

I mean... don't they get it??\nMyself and three partners scheduled a round at McCormick Ranch on 2-11-13. Unfortunately the weather in Scottsdale didn't cooperate. It was in the lower 40's and raining when we woke up. We decided to head over in hopes it would clear. Cold weather is fine... rain and warm is fine... rain and cold makes for a miserable time.\nWhen we checked in at the pro shop, it was only cold (about 42 degrees) and the staff in the pro shop said they checked the radar and the rain was done. Half way through the first hole, it started raining; however we forged on because we were told the radar looked good. On the fourth hole it was still raining and we were soaked to the bone, and very cold.\nWe headed back to the pro-shop to call it a day. We asked if we could split the cost with the golf course... we would pay for nine (we only played 3 1/2 holes) and they could refund us nine. My past experience has been that we could get a full refund because we only play a few holes.\nThey told us we could come back tomorrow to play, which would've been fine, but our flight was at 5:00pm the same day. They then told us that the course was not closed, so either we could play or not play but a refund of any amount wasn't going to happen.\nI hope you use the $475 you got from us for 3 1/2 holes of play wisely, because I will let everyone I know to stay far away from McCormick Ranch Golf Club.\n... and to think that a good will gesture on your part to split the cost with us would've resulted in a rave review."

    "text": "The Deuce is great way to get around Vegas, but like the LV Monorail, it does have a set of positives and negatives.\nPositives\n- More stops on the Strip than the Monorail. There's almost one outside every major resort.\n- $20 for 3 days unlimited rides is a great deal if you want to go up and down the Strip (and you probably will). One quick note is that not all Ticket Dispensers on the Strip offer the 3-day pass. I can't name the exact locations, but based off my last trip, I know the machines at The Wynn bus stop offer it. There's also a stop outside the Fashion Show Mall on Spring Mountain Road in front of Macy's that has a locals rate of $5 for a 24 hour pass, which in actuality is the best deal when you break it down.\n- It also gives you access to venture to Downtown Vegas, and also travel out to the off-strip areas like Summerlin and Chinatown. This is probably the best perk, especially if you want to eat at a lot of the popular off-strip restaurants like Bachi Burger, Raku, Lotus of Siam, etc.\n- Buses are Air Conditioned!!\nNegatives\n- Traveling by bus on the Strip during peak hours is slow, I mean \"tortoise and the hare\" slow. You actually benefit more by just walking.\n- Missing a bus means you'll have to wait another 15-20 minutes for the next one to arrive. Sometimes this has let me option for a taxi or walk over the Monorail since their trains arrive more often.\nOverall I think the pros still outweigh the cons and whenever I visit Vegas, I always get a 3-day pass immediately when I get there. Plus it's just nice to ride and take a load off after walking in the hot summer days."

First of all, there was a 45 minute wait for brunch at 12:30 but we were ok with that. There was live music and it was a beautiful day to sit in the courtyard and wait. We enjoyed some lemonade and coffee while we waited. Then as time went by we realized people who arrived after us were getting seated. Apparantly we got skipped over by the hostess. Nonetheless, once we pointed this out we were promplty seated.\nThe Fritatta of the day is one of their specials and the Meat Fritatta was on the board. It sounded delicious and I knew from the start that is what I wanted. When we sat down, we ordered amongst other things, the fritatta, a tuna melt and another lemonade. Turns out they are out of Lemonade. The server then returns to inform us they are out of Fritattas as they usually run out by noon. I suggested that perhaps if they always run out by noon to make enough to last until 2:00 or take the special off the board if you are out. Either way I decided to settle for a tuna melt as well.\nBut what do you know - they were out of tuna too!\nIf you go to Palatte, the atmosphere is quaint but bring your patience and a sack lunch!"

I wasn't waiting long at all before I was seated. \nThe shampoo room is relaxing and has different music from the salon that allows you to calm yourself with the aromas of the shampoo/conditioner of your choice. \nHaving the hair cut brings me to my only part of my complaint, but it is very well understandable. The students have to discuss with their teachers about what they are going to do with their client and how they will cut it, so this is very time consuming. There are many check-ins with the teacher, but this amounts to a great hair cut/color/whatever you do with your hair. \nHair wash, cut, dry/style was $15. \nI got a shine on mine that is said to last 4-6weeks and this was $20. \nVery happy person with fantastic locks that were blowing in the Vegas breeze! This place is worth the wait, and I would not recommend you coming here if you are in a hurry, To top it off, if you are weary about \"just students\" cutting your hair, the specialists/teachers will fix your hair with no extra charge if something does manage to go wrong."

Even though we had a fun time everyone in our party independently came to the conclusion that we wouldn't come back here. \nI really don't understand the reviews that are raving about how beautiful the place is. Visually it has nothing on XS and even compared to Tryst or Surrender it hardly impresses (I realize I just named all Wynn/Encore properties, no I'm not affiliated with them, they just happen to have elegant clubs :))\nThe level of service we got at Marquee was way below what we would expect for the kind of money involved (2k minimum got us a terrible table, so we upped our minimum to get a decent table). My buddy described it as \"they're phoning it in\" because it is so popular. I think that kind of describes it. Our hostess was absent most of the time and so I wasnt feeling generous and my patience was wearing thin when at the end of the night we had money left over and she insisted it couldn't be closed out without purchasing something. I explained that i understood what a minimum was and that was ok with me I just wanted to close out and get my ID and card back and obviously they keep the difference, we had only agreed to that minimum anyway to get the bigger table. What would be the point of us waiting for her to come open another bottle and bring a bunch of mixers when we were about to leave and what a waste anyway. Just take the money, how hard is that? We literally had a 20 minute argument about this. she even had the audacity to suggest I use the money to buy her a bottle of champagne to take home. Are you serious? I wasnt allowed to use the excess to buy the bottle for the table next to me but I could buy it for the hostess that was invisible half the night? Could hardly believe what she was saying. The whole thing made no sense and was just aggravating for no reason.\nMy friends and I have had excellent service in a variety of clubs in vegas, so what is Marquee's problem? Power to them that they are the 'it' club of the moment but they already lost our return business so good luck to them a year or two from now when the novelty fades. I don't expect them to have much staying power. \nTo offset my bitterness about this experience I'm going to go write a positive review about Lavo and the service we got there the previous night. Sure its a small club and not as fancy but we got treated like gold for spending 25% of what we spent at Marquee."

The parking lots are always and forever extra full you must drive around in circles for what seems like hours just to park your car. Once in the mall or shall I say at the mall you have to walk and walk to get to anything or any place. And I swear people who are here are extra rude they just bump into you and act like they have no home training at all. The people in store are no different. Should u buy something and find issues and take it back they will tell you no you cant exchange it no you can't have a refund. These shops are like a upscale flea market. You can get name brand everything but everything is sold as is. So make sure that your last season items are ok before you decide to exit the store in the first place. I'm glad I'm able to pass on this knowledge to you because lord knows they work on a Got your money and wont give it back kind of deal. Then they push your buttons to see if you will go nuts.

Frank Lloyd Wright makes for an unassuming establishment. Upon entering, you are welcomed into a simple environment with a menu where one can find everything from traditional Italian pasta dishes to dishes with veal or seafood. \nTheir traditional garden salad is a generous portion of lettuce, a sprinkle of tomato, and cucumbers served with your choice of ranch, blue cheese or house vinaigrette dressing ($3.95). You receive a large portion of salad for this unbeatable price. The house vinaigrette in particular, is light and coats every inch of the salad with taste.\nFor the main course, the \"chicken parmesana\" ($14.95) as spelled on their menu, takes a different twist. Instead of a coated breaded chicken breast, theirs is simply a grilled chicken breast covered with a thick covering of mozzarella and mild marinara sauce. Along with this dish, a serving of spaghetti with marinara sauce give the pasta compliment to this dish. There is no lack of mozzarella cheese on this dish; every bite brings a delicious taste to any cheese lover. \nFor dessert, their homemade chocolate chip cannoli ($5.95) is not to be missed. A savory pastry shell is filled with traditional cannoli style cream, topped with many chocolate chips. It is a most filling dessert; their cannoli can easily be split between two individuals.\nWith a simple atmosphere, Nick's simply focuses on what is most important - the food. With a menu with many selections to choose from and delectable dishes, you can find a hearty Italian specialty easily at Nick's Italian Restaurant."

I think you're better off with beer or paying the price for some of their specialty drinks, as the malibu/pineapple was not strong. I've been to this location twice. The first time, I had a steak salad that was to-die-for that has since been removed from the menu :( Last time I went with my boyfriend and we split the Sugar Factory Salad and a Tomato Basil Pizza. They were nice enough to add marinara to the pizza, which doesn't come with it, but only a little. Over all a nice place to go if you want to get one of their gigantic goblet drinks for fun ($36), or if you're out on the strip anyway, but pretty pricey for a dinner out. The first time I went was for a bachelorette party and they were very accommodating and friendly. The second time, we had a Groupon :)\nEdit: forgot to mention the dessert - we had the drunken sundae, which consisted of Guinness gelato topped with Irish whiskey sauce, miniature brownies, and whipped cream (all non-alcoholic) and it was AMAZING.

The kitchen setup is roughly the same with a well oiled machine of an assembly line working. The menu looks a bit like Denny's but with less choices. The prices are a bit more than you would expect to spend at a place like this, but the food amount is worth it. \nThe waitresses go to the tables, take the order, go back behind the counter and call out the order. And it has to be done a certain way too. There is a lead and three other people cooking, each with their specific job. The lead is handling the bread and the waffle irons. The others deal with the potatoes, eggs, and meats. The basic meal is eggs, potatoes, bacon or sausage and toast. You can substitute grits for the potatoes. We ordered \"1 scrambled, grits, bacon over cooked, wheat and 1 scrambled, potatoes scattered, bacon, sourdough.\" And proceeded to watch the production continue. It was fun to see the whole thing and how quickly our food came out. No written orders were kept in front of the cooks, it was all by memory. There were a few people learning different rolls and funny to see them picking up all the nuances of the waffle house machine. \nThe food was good. A bit greasy, but lots of food and fast.

Now, as Becketts Table, your lucky to get a reservation on Friday or Saturday and even luckier to go on a weekday and not find a line of people waiting in the rears. The interior of the restaurant has been completely renovated and it looks great. Whenever I see an open kitchen, i cant help but think it gives some credibility to the kitchen ethic.\nMyself and companion started out with the chicken liver pate and the appetizer special of the night, a pork belly enchilada. Both appetizers were a real treat and something I would not generally find around my local restaurants here in Arcadia. For the entrees I had the short ribs and my companion had the chicken and dumplings. The short ribs were very tasty and by the amount of orders going out of the kitchen, I can tell its a big hit. The chicken and dumplings were a solid dish, but I think I would have liked a side of rice or some starch to go with it. \nService was right on point, environment was great and the food was extremely solid. I would recommend this place to anyone and I will be back soon to enjoy it again myself."

I love the gyro combo but here is a tip I have learned - order your gyro with a side of feta for 75 cents and it will rock your world. I also order an extra side of tzatziki sauce ( had to google how to spell that, whew) and a side of their HOT SAUCE. Get it, its amazing and hot and goes perfectly with the tzatziki sauce and fries. I am counting the days until I am back in Phoenix so I can go there."

A bowl of beef noodle stew will run you sixteen dollars. I ended up paying a grip for a simple noodle stew, some scallion pancakes, and some braised beef. The broth was definitely weak in flavor, and the noodles were only acceptable. Definitely come here only if you have some comp points to spare. Hate to sound like a degenerate gambler but the only advantage is that its quick so you can get back to the tables ASAP. Besides that, it is incredibly overpriced, and falls way short in quality. Don't come here expecting anything close to traditional taiwanese noodle foods!"

At the end we left with what we wanted, but man, the employees here are kind of crazy!!\nFrom the minute we walked in, they didn't leave us alone or stop talking until we walked out!! \nCoach employee: \"Hi guys, welcome to Coach Men's! Where are you guys from?\"\nUs: \"Here.\"\nCoach employee: \"Here??\"\nUs: \"Umm....yeah.\"\nCoach employee: \"Wow, we don't really get locals shopping here.\"\nWhat I wanted to say: \"Oh I'm sorry, am I not welcome here because I'm a local?\"\nA soft spoken Asian girl helped us at first. We told her that we were looking for a slim wallet, nothing too bulky. She suggested and showed us their slim billfold wallets with the ID window. Then another employee has the nerve to butt in and gives us a pitch about how their bigger double billfold wallets are popular, how some people like to buy a money clip and a card holder, blah, blah, blah. Umm first of all, the other girl was helping us first, jerk! So let her help us! Second, we already said that we were interested in slim wallets only. So if you don't know what that means, google it, then STFU! LOL. \nMy husband finally decided on what color he wanted. Then, as he was trying to decide which font/finish to go with for the free engraving, (apparently, they offer free engraving of your initials for most of their products) guess what the jerk tried to do? He tried to sell ME a men's bag. Yup, he wouldn't STFU about \"well, it is Coach men's but women can use our bags too. Our messenger bags are the top sellers and they are unisex....\" Uhhh, how about NO. Not hating in any way. He obviously saw the Coach women's cross body bag that I had and I was pretty annoyed that he wouldn't back off when it was obvious that I wasn't interested. \nFinally paid and got outta there! Although we had to come back in 30 minutes after they finished engraving the wallet. When we returned, the jerk was trying to sell stuff to another couple. Hope they survived!\nWon't be coming back here for a while. I feel sorry for all the employees at this store that has to work with this guy! I like Coach, but really don't appreciate some of their pushy employees."

Now, I think i'm in love.\nThe food is amazing. Everything on our table was delicious, and I wouldn't change a thing about any of it. I had the incredible Potato mish mash, and my dining companion loved the griddle cakes and a side of chicken sausage. The breakfast potatoes are tasty and cooked to perfection. The toast was great- not your typical sandwich bread slices. \n One thing that really endears me to this place is the fact that they do not serve tap water. It is a small thing, yes, but living in a city with horrid water makes me appreciate restaurants that take the extra care to serve their guests something that they themselves would drink.\nI cannot say enough good things about this place. The atmosphere is great, even when the place is packed, decorated with French country flair and pieces that would make my living room swoon. The outdoor seating area is equally adorable, and huge. The majority of the items they have in and around the restaurant are for sale, and there is a small gift shop in the rear of the restaurant for other quirky items. \nOne last thing- if you go, and you should, do not leave Palatte without checking out the bathrooms. (both of them) You've never seen anything like it, promise."

The restaurant was practically empty and the service was extremely slow. I had their chopped salad to start which was described as having tomatoes, bleu cheese, and prosciutto among the ingredients. They were so sparse and tiny that it practically took a magnifying glass to see them amongst all the lousy iceberg. A definite ripoff and disappointment. My entree wasn't terrible--ordered off the light menu. \nEven though we specified when we ordered how we wanted the checks split; at the close of the meal, we were told by our server that their system wouldn't do that and that we should pass around the master bill and figure it out for ourselves. After getting a manager involved and quite a lengthly wait, we finally got our totals and were out of there. This lunch experience in a nearly empty restaurant took almost 2 hrs.

Make sure the weather is good because all the seating is outdoors. Since this is Vegas, it hardly ever disappoints. \nMy wife and I ordered the 3-meat plate with tri-tip, rib tips, and the pulled pork. The two complementary sides we ordered were the cole slaw and the much regarded mac-n-cheese. \nLet me start with the rib tips since that is the reason I came. If I could eat only these, I would be a happy man. The meat is tender, seasoned perfect, and cooked perfectly as well. The tri-tip (which is served only on Tuesdays and Thursdays) was thinly sliced, tender, juicy, and much better with the sauce. The pulled pork was a close second to the rib-tips. It was tender, juicy, not too much sauce, and incredible flavor.\nThe mac-n-cheese is not your run of the mill pasta and powdered cheese sauce crap from a box. It is giant pasta, real cheese, meat, and pretty decent flavor. Not bad, but then again, I'm not a mac-n-cheese fan.\nFinally, the cole slaw. You can really tell whether a BBQ joint is serious by their cole slaw. Sadly, we found a long hair on the first bite and I just couldn't bring myself to try any of it.\nWe ended with the peach cobbler which was outstanding.\nI really wish I could give this place a higher rating, I can still taste those rib-tips. Unfortunately the hairy cole slaw just can't be shrugged off. If I return, it will be for the rib tips, and not for any sides. But, they do have other meat selections that I would like to try. After all, this is a butcher shop and it appears they do know how to prepare meat."

Since the polish dog and the bacon overload was too much for the buns, it looked quite messy. Well, with two hot dogs, a side of fries, and a coke... Our total was $18. Bull!\nPros:\n-short line... Fast food\n-addicting fries and onion rings\n-good portion... Very filling for me especially the fries\n-opens late so it's good for after clubbing or unless you're a fatty like me and wants to have a midnight dinner err snack..\n-they sell jello shots here\nCons:\n-even though the line is short, it's so boring. I like that rush of excitement where you see people all hyped up about it order a ton of food and end up not finishing it\n-very greasy... Made my buns soggy \n-overpriced hot dogs that I can get at Costco for only $1.50 with a free drink\n-outdoor seatings only\n-my boyfriend wasnt satisfied so it made me look bad.

The pizza was pretty darn good, we ordered half gladiator and half fallen angel with all of the free add ons! This includes garlic, fresno peppers, onions and an egg!! The trick that one of the staff recommended to us (that we completely forgot yo do but will do next time) was to have the egg cooked over medium since they typically serve the egg sunny side up which can be too runny for most. I personally liked the gladiator more than the fallen angel. We also decided to go with a growler which you can decide to keep or just drink at the table (of course we decided to keep it for am extra $12). It is such a uniquely shaped growler! Super cute, reminds me of a genie bottle! The ambiance was very romantic with dim candle lighting and all of the staff was so friendly and helpful!

We were having a good time and met another couple, my wife and her new friend who had just got married decided to dance on the back part of a sofa, the part were everyone else was dancing. They were there having a good time, when a D-bag manager or pr guy decided to come over to the table in front, he hit on them but when he noticed that we were there as couples he told them to get down from there and in a rude way said \"you are regular people\". I do not know what that means, but we paid to get in and I was paying $30 for a beer and a small cup of vodka and cranberry. I do not know if I am regular people because I am Mexican, dark skin or not a high roller. He was there like a good D bag drinking from the table bottle and bringing single girls. What ever he does to try to get laid it's cool but when someone that is supposed to be an authority and represent a high-end club calls the costumers \"regular people\". Something is wrong. \nI am sharing a picture in case you see him be aware he does not like \"regular people\" in his club, you need to spend $10,000 and get a table so he can hit on drunk girls and then you will not be \"regular people\". \nOne of the high points of the night was the guys that work in the bathroom, always nice, always smiling and never expecting or asking for a tip. They would always ask if you need anything else, if you were having fun and if you were ok. They do not get enough credit for the difficult job they have. \nThe music was great and the sound was good too. We liked the Tiesto blacelets they passed out.

Suffice it to say, we were completely underwhelmed...and it did not redeem the disastrous meal we'd endured.\nMichel, please don't set up a restaurant like this and leave town...You've not got the right people in place to maintain consistency, quality and to operate a 24/7 operation with your name on the door.

If the thought of this makes you uncomfortable, this place isn't for you. I've been consistently happy with my haircuts here and have fun talking to the staff.\nBe warned: even though you can pay for your haircut with a credit card, you must tip in cash. I find this pretty irritating because I don't normally use cash and have to remember to stop at the ATM to pick some up beforehand."

I purchased a piece of luggage worth around $100 for almost $300 because the salesman convinced me that the luggage had a lifetime warranty. \nHe looked me in the eye and told me my luggage would be supported or replaced by them at any time. He's a really good salesman - he smiles, makes you laugh and makes you feel like he's really honest. He'll go on for 10 to 15 minutes on the craftsmanship and quality behind the bags that they sell. \nHe'll make promises and guarantees to sell you a piece of luggage but in reality falls apart like any other luggage you purchase elsewhere without their excessive price \"service\" premiums. \nWhen I went in with \"lifetime\" warrantee luggage that he sold me that had defective wheels and a defective zipper that began disconnecting from the seams - he looked me in the eye and told me that I had a \"convenient\" memory. He laughed at the idea that he told me there was a lifetime warranty on this luggage. I told him I was insulted that he misrepresented the craftsmanship behind this bag and overcharged me for a product that was not worth the premium he collected - he offered me 10% off another piece of luggage and said he was insulted. \nSpecialty luggage is staffed by slimy salesman who lie and misrepresent facts to sell you over priced products that do not justify the premiums they gauge customers for."

Unfortunately, they only do lunch specials on weekdays (not out of the ordinary I suppose) so my lunch entree was $8 plus my soda so about $14 with tax/tip which I normally wouldn't consider \"cheap\" for lunch. \nBUT, the food was AWESOME. I had the drunken noodles with tofu. It was the first time ever that I couldn't eat all the noodles (believe me, I tried). Huge portion, and very tasty. I asked for a \"medium\" spicy and it was perfect - just a little too spicy - just how I like it. My only complaint about the food was that the tofu was a little too chewy/hard. I didn't specifically want soft tofu, but they fried it too long in my opinion. Otherwise, very yummy. And did I mention that there were a TON of noodles? Seriously. \nI will definitely try to stop in during lunch on a weekday and try something else on their menu. I have a feeling it will all be good."

I went with a group of 6 (one of our friends is a regular here) and it was fantastic! \nDon't be alarmed when your GPS takes you to a house. This property belongs to the owners but they've turned the huge outdoor lot into a trapeze training environment. Put your apprehensions aside and go forth because this'll be one of the most fun experiences you'll ever have! \nOur trainer, Stefan, along with the rest of the team, are real pros at trapeze and have made it their life's work. You're in good hands as they are professional, fun, and encouraging. \nInitially you will practice on the ground as each person in your group takes a turn. Then, you'll give it a shot up in the air. The ladder is small and thin but it's sturdy and it does the job. They rotate through each person - in this class we went around 5 times (5 cracks at it for each person) and were there for about 2.5 hours. \nIf you have a fear of heights, all I can say is clear your mind and allow your body and mind to enjoy an exhilarating experience. I know that's easier said than done - I would imagine, in phobia-land, it's a lot like asking me to go into a room filled with insects and rodents. Nothing good can come of that, though, but you WILL enjoy trapeze if you can coax yourself out of your comfort zone. Also, the thrill and pride you feel when you improve and even succeed at the task at hand is enough of a reward! \nSome tips: bring water - you're outdoors in the desert. When you're practicing, you won't have the harness on and will be completely upside down. Men, that may mean nothing to you but, ladies, boobs are not a part of this show... at least not yet. (Sounds like they're working on that, though, so naked trapeze may not be too far off). You might want to consider wearing a tight-fitted shirt that won't drop down. Spandex just may be your friend. Wear flip flops. You'll be taking your shoes off anyway. And lastly, just allow yourself to have fun. \nHappy flying!"

Few patrons seem to frequent English's even on a Friday or Saturday night during their reverse happy hour from 9PM - 11PM! Maybe it's the location? This trendy little restaurant is located at Town Square on the second floor just down the hallway from Blue Martini. \nFirst off, I can only attest to my experience for English's Happy Hour. The reverse happy hour is a big draw, as are the appetizers that are priced just right. I've ordered the cheese plate at least 3 times, and let me tell you, that cheese plate is the bees knees. It's a bargain for only $5. It comes with around 6 different slices of artisanal cheeses that are packed with flavor. The cheeses are accompanied by crusty bread and a couple of dipping sauces. By the way, according to the menu, the cheese plate only comes with 3 varieties of cheeses, but I've always received at least 5 variations each time I've ordered it. \nI wouldn't recommend the chip curry ($3), and the beer ($5) can be hit or miss. It's pretty common to hear that they're run out of a popular type of beer for the reverse happy hour. Also, during my last visit, they admitted that the beer was not cold. WTF? How are you going to serve lukewarm temperature beer? We ordered beer anyways and sure enough, the beer was about room temp.\nService is extremely slow and like other yelpers have mentioned, almost nonexistent. Our waiter literally forget about us and we quickly learned to order 2 drinks at a time so we wouldn't have to wait around for him to come around. To make things more frustrating, the place is empty so it's not like there's an excuse for slow service. The staff likes to gather around and chit chat. \nSorry English's, but your delicious cheese plate can't save you!"

I had the Duck, Duck, Dates with the apricot sauce on top. The sausage was very tasty, but it sure was a tiny little thing! They could have served it with a roll 1/2 the size and eased up on the amount of the apricots, which totally masked the flavor. I also had the fries, which were very good, and the blue cheese bacon dipping sauce that had no flavor at all and looked like milk more than a dipping sauce. I also loved the pickled veggies they served with the sandwich.\nI am not a fan of high top tables either, and the only regular tables are outside. \nThe food was great, but as far as value goes, there are much better options out there.

They encouraged us to take whatever bikes we wanted out into the lot to ride 'em around. They talked with us about what we wanted to do with the bikes. My dad wanted to ride more on the street; I wanted to work up to conquering dirt paths. They recommended a 70% street bike for my dad, who could take it off-road if he wanted. They suggested I get a bike that is designed for more mountaineering but won't scoff at riding on pavement. \nTheir selection was wide enough that we had a somewhat difficult time deciding what to get. With the help of the staff, we narrowed our choices down and bought two bikes. My dad jokingly asked what he could get for free, and they guy who helped us joked back before throwing in two free water bottles. That was cool. \nI didn't get any accessories or anything, but whenever I think about investing in a helmet or more padding on my tush, I always think of going back to DNA Cycles.

Rather than ramble on about ambiance, the service, the location I'll cut right to what matters: the food. I'm a vegetarian and as such I accept that my dining options are not as vast as those with unrestricted diets. However, Asian cuisine is generally very veg friendly and as such I dine at Asian restaurants probably more than any other type of restaurant. Unfortunately, Republic Ramen falls a touch short of what I'd call \"Veg Friendly\". The only option you'll have is the Vegetarian Ramen, which is OK because that is what I came in there for. And while the ramen was good (very rich, salty and tons of toppings) one dining option is not enough to make me a regular. It would be nice to try, say some udon noodles or an appetizer that isn't edamame.\nAgain, the ramen is good. And the price is fair. But would it really be so bad to leave the fish sauce out of a dish or two? Or to try using a vegetarian dashi instead of a fish-based dashi?"

He got us into the club afterward and gave us a bunch of free drink tickets, which was very nice of him. \nThe theme and decor is tasteful. You can see a lot of time went into choosing every fascia, from the bathroom sinks, to the bathtub hall. There is a heavy Asian theme but with the name Tao we shouldn't expect anything else. Asian accents throughout the entire club. Dark walls and flooring accented with red museum lights and Asian accents.\nThe downstairs dance floor was packed but oddly, not full of douche bags. Don't get me wrong, douche bags were in attendance as they always are at clubs but the ratio of douche baggery wasn't high. Kinda unexpected. especially for a club in Vegas. Girls in attendance were beautiful and the bartenders and hostesses were even hotter.\nThe electronically activated frosted glass bathrooms surrounding the dance floor is a nice touch. Although don't forget to lock the door or the glass stays clear! I'm sure the girl peeing for everyone to see can attest to that.\nThe upstairs pool area is where this club really shines. Coming up to the pool area from the hot dance floor, we are greeted with open skies and even more dance floor. The music was great all night and everyone came out for a good time. Low douche bag ratio, high spirits, and outstanding decor is what separates this club from the rest. Tao has set a new standard for the mega club and should be a benchmark here on in.\nOverall, I had an amazing experience at Tao. The drink prices were reasonable and the crowd is energetic. Definitely coming back and recommending this club to anyone looking to party in Vegas but then again, isn't Vegas a constant party?"

It was small, so it wasn't too loud. The waitresses were pretty attentive, which is always important. \nThis sushi restaurant was a nice change from others I've been to. At some sushi places all the rolls start tasting the same, but every roll here had its own distinct taste.\nI was excited for two things here: tuna carpaccio and the sashimi roll, mostly because they seemed popular on yelp. The tuna was okay, I wasn't amazed. The sashimi roll was kind of weird, I didn't actually taste much of the fish.\nThe big hits in the group was the Kimmi Roll, Big B roll, and of course the salmon Nigiri. The interesting part of the Big B roll is that it has a small slice of beef. I usually try to steer away from rolls like this because I came for fish, but it was delicious and I think we would have gotten another if we didn't want to try the other rolls first. The nigiri had a good rice to fish ratio. \nThe misses were the paina and paradise roll. The paradise fish roll seemed like such a great idea because it had all these different kinds of fishes, but alas it just didn't stand out. The Paina roll didn't have taste, it just seemed like a roll of rice with batter around it."

No signs, no prominent entryway, no nothing. Just a darkened corridor that leads to a hallway (where the wind blew in and toppled you over nonetheless) with weird art. Once inside the bathroom, you're crammed inside, until some loud bathroom attendant literally orders you to a stall. I was sitting there, peeing, thinking the attendant would yell at me to stop peeing and get out! \nAlso, some support for my argument - someone puked on the floors and we had to take a detour. \n#3. The long haul back to exit the club. It was a looong trip to exit the club. You have to take around 3 flights of stairs through the ugliest part of the club. This is probably the worst for women in heels. And yet, if they can provide an elevator UP to the club, why not provide it down, when people are inebriated and tired? \nMarquee makes you work for your fun - which is not fun!!!!!! Though, I still had fun because it's Vegas, but really.....wth!"

The ambience is fantastic - dark, comfy seating, great decor.\nService was excellent. When I didn't like the drink I ordered, the server let me taste something else before pouring. Every course was explained and questions asked to the chef and answered (my brother is in culinary school and had a few questions). The timing was perfect - not too fast or slow.\nThe food was amazing. My brother and cousin ordered the 4 course tasting menu and I had the 6 course chef's menu. We shared each course which was perfectly prepared, presented and sized.\nThey have an absinthe cart that we did not sample, but it looked interesting. \nI would not hesitate to recommend this restaurant or eat there again the next time I'm in Las Vegas!"

We decided to start with a frozen hot chocolate, then have a late lunch and take the carrot cake to go. The frozen hot chocolate was more for him than me, and as I suspected, I wasn't a fan. \nHe chose the cookies and cream flavor. It was big and covered in whipped cream, but too syrupy sweet and water-y for me, but he enjoyed it, though he probably wouldn't order it again. Worth experiencing once, though! \nThe star of the show for me was the mac and cheese, which was decadent and perfectly seasoned. He went with a turkey club sandwich which was surprisingly tasty and gigantic (the portion sizes make the pricing pretty reasonable for the strip, in my opinion) and so between the two of us we had a really satisfying meal. I had to resist nabbing most of his fries. \nThen, the waitress brought us our to go cake and I nearly fell out of my chair. It was a HUGE slab of cake, with lots of thin layers and plenty of cream cheese frosting. I was still chipping away at it three days later and I'm a big eater. In the end, I didn't even finish the whole thing. If I was to do it again, I'd go with the sundae version, mixing cake and vanilla ice cream and eat it there. \nMy only real disappointment was in the decor, I expected it to be cuter inside, but it appeared they were doing a remodel and also, I'm pretty snobby about that sort of thing. I also wasn't too keen on the scratched, cloudy looking plastic water glasses, but again, I'm pretty picky about details.\nAll in all, it was a fun afternoon outing and I enjoyed it."

We have the geeksquad protection on it, so we got there at 1004 this morning when the store opened.\nWhile he was being helped, I looked around their laptop section. First off, I am kind of disappointed, because I thought they would have a bigger selection.. at least, before they redid the store.......I think I remember it being bigger.\nTwenty minutes go by, and someone comes around with a clip board asking me if I needed help. He took down my name and said the next associate would be with me as soon as they were available. \nWhatever guy, I haven't seen you ask for anyone else's name(s) and there are other people in this section being helped, and rung up.\nFinally, this guy comes over. And I ask him which laptop he would get, if he could buy one today. He lead me over to a 4th generation Toshiba. I've never owned a Toshiba. My Dell laptop is almost seven years old, and ready to bite the dust. When I ask him to point out his second pick for me, he takes me over to another laptop. When I ask him why he would choose this one..... His answer was \"it's a touch screen.\"\nNot because it has more memory, or that it's faster, or it's a better value..... Because it has a f#cking touchscreen....? Really?\nThe Toshiba was on special. For$ 399, you got the laptop, a sleeve, 6months of internet security, a mouse and a flash drive. Big effing deal..... Right ? But for $399... I won't complain.\nSo after that lacking customer \"service\" experience... We go to check out. ....which wasn't busy at all....we were able to walk right up. I go up there with the computer, and Madden game. The cashier didn't even bother saying hello. She rudely rang up my computer bundle, and the game. She then tried to sell me geek squad protection... One year for $100. I asked if the computer had a warranty already on it... And she very snottly said yes, a manufacter's..for a year.\nWell, then take your year coverage......and you know what to do with it. \nSo, after paying almost $500 on two items, she didn't even offer me a bag. So, I carried the laptop and loose game out..... But of course, I was stopped by the doorman, who just has to check my freaking receipt. \nUtterly pissed."

They offer smaller portions too, but be prepared either way. \nTheir sweet cream pancakes are the biggest rave! I can't argue with that. They taste like birthday cake, minus the icing. Fluffy, moist, and the right amount of sweet. The country fried steak is a must try! Hailing from the mid-west, a good fried steak is crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. They DO that here. They use the same technique with their hash browns. Add some Heinz 57 to them, you're in for treat. \nAlthough located in a busy area and at times can be packed full of people, it's worth making the stop. The lumberjack-like atmosphere and teddy bears gives this place its name. They do country right here folks."

    "text": "Pleasantly surprising. They serve Royal (@ the Market), for those interested.\nBeing pretty hip to the coffee scene in PHX, I was a little surprised to hear of this new shop, having not heard of it's coming. Maybe I didn't look around enough, but it felt like Nami just kind of popped up.\nSo I had my doubts, as I always will when giving a new place a shot. The layout was pleasant, and the decor pretty rad; love the couch. Parking seems sorted out a great deal better than when That's A Wrap inhabited the area - good plus there. Sweets looked great.\nSo I order my typical - drip and a 2x (on the side). This gives me a general idea of the shop; milk drinks are for second and beyond trips. Firstly, their demi-tasses are super cute. Obviously hand-made, and hopefully local. Loved it. My drip actually turned out to be a pour-over, which is a plus to me. A coffee junkie can appreciate a pour-over, where it kind of scares a person just wanting some \"coffee\" (see: I understand why you call it drip vs pour-over).\nStraight up espresso is generally a quick way of determining bad-average-good. Crema was nice though, consistent, and had me thinking I might have a decent thing here. Taste was good, creamy and quite chocolatey (which seems the profile of the beans being used - the drip was reminiscent of the same). Said and done (from a 'snob' standpoint), the espresso was good, not mindblowing. I think the grind was right, but either the dosing could be moved up a tiny bit, or tamped a little harder. Granted, this was the first and only I had there, so I can't necessarily base the entire shop on that one dopio. All in all, I'm saying it was good, and while the extraction time was right, it could use a little more density.\nThe drip (see: pour-over) clearly used the same roast, which isn't a complaint. The same chocolatey, creamy notes were abound. I feel the dosing was very light, and should have either been a 12oz, or more grounds used. I actually felt I was drinking a water heavy coffee. Not terrible, but certainly not great. I have a sneaking suspicion if the measurement was a bit closer, it would have been a much better brew. Pour-overs are an art first, for sure, then a science. I think they have potential here. Maybe a better pot would help with this brew method as well.\n-- I'll be back. My experience was neither mind-blowing nor off-putting. I'm hoping after they get into the swing of things and get the kinks ironed out, this will be one of the cooler stops in PHX. Certainly a great concept and whatnot."

This year my friend's Food Network crush (come on, we all have one...) on Gordon Ramsay led us to BurGR. Hot off the plane, we headed over to Planet Hollywood. After wandering around for awhile, unable to find BurGR, we asked someone...naturally, at that point we were practically on top of it. Duh.\nAfter a short wait, we were seated. Our stripper I mean waitress came by and explained the menu to us. It's somewhat limited....burgers (duh #2), including chicken, pork, and portobello burgers, a couple salads, a couple hot dog choices, a fish sandwich...plus some apps, shakes, and fries. We wound up going with the Hell's Kitchen Burger and banana shake for her, and the Uber Cheese Burger (FYI, \"uber cheese\" = 3 different kinds) and chocolate shake for me. We ordered regular fries to share, which came with chipotle ketchup and curry ketchup.\nThe shakes arrived first...ok, there is pudding on top of them. How can that be bad? A shake and pudding combined takes care of all kinds of girl needs. We were in love.\nWe also really enjoyed our burgers...the meat was of excellent quality and very flavorful. Even the bun was good. The fries, however, left something to be desired....they were not terrible, but the burgers and shakes were so fab, we felt let down. The 2 ketchups were tasty, but the fries seemed like maybe they were sitting around for awhile? Which I find hard to believe, since they must serve fries all day long. So I guess if there IS one thing Gordon Ramsay can't do...it's fries. But we got over it. \nWe would surely go to BurGR again (duh #3)....I'd love to try some of the other burgers and shakes....however, we'd pass on the fries....the next table had an appetizer of onion rings, maybe we'd get those instead. \nA very solid 4 stars."

She was up at the station getting menus and taking them to another part of the restaurant and then coming back with them and still sort of ignoring us. It was irritating. There were two other groups in the lobby area with about 5-6 people each. The hostess told us it would be 40 minutes. She said they had plenty of tables open, but hardly any servers. We decided to leave and go elsewhere. I'll update after we actually make it past the lame teenage hostess in less than 40 minutes. Hopefully they'll get some waitstaff by then...\nUpdate:\nI did manage to get seated and eat a meal here. The deep fried mushrooms were great and very tasty. The service was mediocre at best. The actual waiter that was waiting our table didn't actually come to our table until the end of our meal. We had the manager and another person waiting our table. The steak I had was overcooked and not that great. Our waiter did offer to bring our another, but I wasn't going to go through all of that at this point. He did manage to give us some free appetizer coupons and I think he got a little bit taken off of the bill. Pretty good for a guy who was never at our table. It wasn't his fault, but he did his best to make it up. Kudos to him - we gave him a decent tip just for that. Next time I think I'll stick to a BBQ sandwich. I'll up it from 2 to 3 stars.\nSecond Update:\nWe gave it another shot with our free appetizer coupons and had a much better experience. They had a great seasonal beer and my pulled pork sandwich was delicious. I think I had a few crazy experiences here, but if I sit inside at a non-crazy time, it should be okay.

They dont overcharge you and dont platter useless fruits all over your plate. I know some folks most probably like fruits with their orders but I think its better to charge extra as a side than just giving a whole bunch of fruits. This gives me more of the particular omelette, smoked salmon bagel, or pancakes that Im having without wasting a lot of fruits. Hash browns are a most order side here. And so is the smoothies, they use real fresh fruits and have a whole bunch of flavors for everyone to choose from in variety of small and large sizes ;)\nBoth the times that I was here, I was served with a happy smile and fast service despite the whole place being packed!!!

One of those benefits is the food served at Z'Tejas, and I will gladly put up with any number of hanging serapes to get my hands on Tex-Mex. \nThis is what you need to order (no exceptions): \n1. Drinks: Chambord Margarita \n2. Appetizer: Cornbread (so moist!) \n3. Entree: Seafood Enchiladas \n4. Dessert: Berry Cobbler. \nYou will need to take a food coma after you have successfully finished all this food. But, and trust me on this one, you will finish it because everything they serve is addictive.

The warm wheat bun was a good surprise - a lot of places seem to just use any old cheap cold hamburger bun. The meat was cooked well, with plenty of flavor, and finished with a pretty good barbecue sauce - not particularly sweet, spicy, tangy, or really anything descriptive - just pretty good.\nFor dessert, I went with the strawberry shortcake. This was not a one-portion dessert (and for $6.95, it's not priced as a one-person dessert either). It was very tasty, but just way too big to finish, and not really something that can be taken home and finished later.\nI enjoyed the food, but it's not something I'd make another special trip to get to."

    "text": "VERY DISAPPOINTED with Mandalay Bay in Vegas!!!\n- I don't usually write reviews but I definitely felt the need to do so today. I travel quite often, and have been to Vegas too many times to count. This was my first stay at Mandalay Bay and I was looking forward to the experience because the pool area is so well reviewed. \n- As with most of my trips this one was a last minute vacation, so I called the hotel directly to book a Spa Suite. \n- I was lured in by the option of paying a fee for early check-in and late check-out, since we were only staying one night I wanted to make the most of it. \n- The reservation clerk assured me that I was guaranteed early check-in, multiple times because if he couldn't arrange it I was more than willing to book another type of suite online and assure I got early check-in, and I told him that. \n- With everything set, my husband and I woke up early, drove to Vegas, got in at 10:30am (I was told the room would be ready by 10am), and attempted to check-in. \n- The room was NOT ready and it seems that the reservation clerk lied! He never booked the early check-in or late check-out as promised. I was willing to upgrade to another suite (as I had seen on the website not more than 6 hours earlier) but I was told that there were no other rooms available (although I was able to book another room on my phone when I tried). They were apologetic and waived my resort fee (little consolation). \n \n- I was checked in, given keys to a \"phantom room\" and told that I would be sent a text message with the room number when my room was ready (I was not a happy camper). \n- We went about our day waiting and waiting and waiting for the text that NEVER came. At 3pm (which is regular check-in time) I called and was told \"we sent you a text message\". Funny how theirs is the ONLY text message I did not receive that day. \n- Once we got to our room (which I must say was a nicely laid out room) the smell of cigarette smoke made you gag. We called the front desk and were assured that this was a non-smoking room. Unfortunately the previous occupants didn't care to follow the rules and used a shower cap (which was still in place) to cover the smoke detector and smoke to their hearts content.\n- The front desk offered to send someone up with an atomizer to deal with the odor (since there were no other rooms available). An hour later, maintenance shows up and informs us that we would need to leave the room for a couple of hours in order for them to use this atomizer. WTF? Seriously?????\n- To make a LONG story slightly less long...... The next night we called for a blanket that never appeared, we asked for a coffee maker that they could not provide, we requested hot water which they wanted $5.00 for (not including the $2.50 delivery fee), and lately this room, which I waited all day for, had a lovely view of the top of a parking structure. To quote my teenagers......all I can say is WOW, really?\n- Needless to say this was my first and LAST stay at Mandalay Bay! Such a shame that they care so little."

    "text": "Like others, I had really looked forward to eating here. I was not thrilled I had to leave a credit card with my reservation, but got over it. \nLovely decor, but nothing spectacular.\nHaving been in Vegas and eaten here at some other celebrity chef restaurants, I was expecting the high prices. The food did live up to my expectations here. Big, bold flavors (I had the pork, others at my table had the veal chop and the venison, and the same for those), perfectly cooked pork, delicious tamales, although a little sweet, went well with the very spicy pork and delicious sauce. Portions were great here, almost too much. Unlike the apps - small portions big prices. Duck \"taco\" - 1 small blue corn soft tortilla with about 3 tablespoons of duck -$16.00. Hard to share with 3 other people - about a tiny bite each! Hard for me to understand the price,although it was tasty. The corn tamale with shrimp was delicious, a little better portion, but was described as having 4 jumbo shrimp - they were hardly jumbo, although we each did get one, and the flavors were good. Again, overpriced at $14 or $16 I can't remember.\nBiggest disappointment was service. Friendly and knowledgeable, yes.\nWe ordered a pretty pricey bottle of wine, and when we ordered apps and told the waiter we would like to hold off on entrees for a few minutes, he basically informed us that we had to order everything at once, they were busy, yada yada yada. There are few things that aggravate me more at a high end restaurant than when they dictate when I have to order what. What is this, Dennys? They can't manage a simple delay of ordering entrees? Mostly, i just felt they were rushing us so they could fill up our table again. Big no,no for me. \nIf you are a Bobby Flay fan, and want ot see how close you come to making his food at home, eating here is a must. (It's not that hard to duplicate his recipes, they are fairly easy, and from this experience I see I can do it spot on). The real true test for me of any restaurant is would I go back?\nNope! There is a lot of great places in Vegas I would go back to, and have, BUT this is not one of them. Easily duplicated, and very pricey, combined with Dennys mentality on the service make it a ONE TIME ONLY EXPERIENCE."

I love this place. \nWhen we moved here a year ago and I found out they were following shortly thereafter, I may have done a happy dance of joy. And it doesn't disappoint! All the original food, even better service, prices way more reasonable than some other Mexican restaurants in town and a huge patio and wait area.\nI also used them for a large to-go order for the first time last weekend and it was a great experience. They didn't try to talk me into an order larger than I planned to purchase (The Big Daddio for 35 people to feed 60+ people... perfect amount), my order was perfectly accurate and well-packaged, hot (which is never something I can assume with a very large to-go order) and they even said if something was wrong they would fix it asap.\nGo to Chuy's.

Seriously, if you like tea, vegan munchies and books, then this is a shop for you! \nThe book selection on display here alone is worth browsing - there are literally shelves and shelves of books lining the majority of the walls in the shop. And the range of things covered by these books stretches from fiction stories like \"The Hunger Games\" and famous sci-fi titles to history and philosophy topics. There's definitely a wide range of options so I think anyone could find something good to read here if they come with an open mind.\nAs for the cafe portion of the shop, I love their tea selections, and all of their food is made from local, organic, seasonal, fair trade, and/or sustainable sourced ingredients. All of their food is vegan as well, so while it can taste a little different to the uninitiated on a first visit (which was me once upon a time), their options really grow on you if you give them a chance. Big Idea is admittedly a small-scale operation so sometimes they're a little low on food, but that's totally forgivable. They make a mean hummus and pita snack, and the staff - all volunteers - are super nice and will do whatever they can to help you; they've even offered to carry my tea back to me once it's done brewing!\nI've definitely come to love this cool little shop more and more over the past year, and now I stop in at least once a month for my tea, snack and book fix.

Almost every other Paradise I have been to has been 5 stars. Unfortunately this location was some what of a disappointment. I saw the site about a new smoothie B-green. I thought it would be a nice change. Well by the time I got to the end of the line to pay they bring me this drink that was grayish in color. They informed me that they had ran out of bananas (which is the base for the drink) and made it wi yogurt instead. I informed them that I was lactose intolerant and they ask if they could make me the same drink without the yogurt or a different smoothie. I asked what ones were dairy free and was told they all have yogurt. Umm ok I was thinking to myself why would they offer me something they know I can't have. I asked for a refund and that was that. \n After sitting down I noticed that the staff was sweeping the store. I noticed that they had swept everything into a line in the middle of each walking area. It seemed that the lines of dirt and food crumbs were there for quite some time after sitting down. It was there long enough for me to eat my salad and have to look at filth swept into a pile. Finally the staff member came by with a dust mop and got all the dirt line in the store. Still sitting and eating after the sweeping was done I wondered why he even swept in the first place or if he did. There was still food, napkins and other things under most of the tables in my section. \nAgain don't get me wrong I love this chain.

    "text": "I became a member of this gym in 2010 because my apartment building at the time offered it free as an incentive. I have to admit--I wasn't really serious about working out at that time, so I just took a body pump class once a week. Eventually I moved and decided to continue my membership on my own. \nThis particular location is not very busy compared to most gyms but depending on who teaches the classes, it can fill up quick. I have to admit that I only maintained this gym membership because of the BODYPUMP instructor Sheryl. I took BP at LVAC and I didn't like how it was taught. It doesn't matter how many times you've been to the class, Sheryl teaches it as if it's your first time. She gives you plenty of motivation and instruction and no upcoming move is a surprise. That's important to me in a class. Staying on beat to the music with no surprise moves is key, because you can injure yourself that way. \nI also like that the age goup is much different than LVAC. The age at this location tends to be on the elderly side, and they like to hang on the machines and talk for long periods of time about WWI, diseases, surgeries, and other various geriatric conversations. I always maintain multiple gyms because I get VERY bored with seeing the same employees, people, equipment, etc. At that time I used 24 as my \"quiet gym\". It was the gym I went to on Saturday night (I know--I'm a nerd) and whenever I wanted to use the classroom for combat ropes and jump roping. It's very rare to find a gym where you can have the classroom all to yourself on just about any day of the week. \nAfter many years kinda doing the same thing, I started to feel like it was time to change my routine. What really helped me make the decision was they eliminated the KIDS CLUB which pissed off one of my friends who took the BP class with me. With no childcare available for her it forced her to switch over to the Wigwam campus. Well when I wanted to switch over with her, they wouldn't let me without a stupid fee because I had Green Valley access only. That sucked! \nSo....I decided to cancel my membership. After threatening to cancel my membership they finally decided to \"hook me up\" with all these discounts, incentives and various other offers because they valued me being with them for so long, but it was just too late. I was ready to move on.\nUnfortunately I made so many friends at that gym and didn't want to leave. Gym rats outside of the BP class asked me where I had been after I had gone on vacation for a month. I was surprised! That caused me to make so many more friends within that gym.\nOnce in a while, I will pay the $10 fee and work out there and say hello to everyone again. Overall this a great gym. Management tends to run people off because for $29.99 you can only be at that particular gym and you don't get any of the amenities that other gyms offer. Classes are VERY few and limited, with limited times and it's pretty much a dead gym--but with that said it's perfect if you're there to \"get 'er done.\" There's no glitz and glamour at this gym. Staff and gym rats are awesome people, and everyone is friendly as if family here."

Upon entering I was greeted and the woman working behind the post office window was not only helpful in choosing the best service to get my package where it needed to be on time but also saving me some money by suggesting I use a different box. Overall, this was way better than any post office experience I've had since no one was rushing to get me through a big long line. There was the charge for using my credit card but for the time and money she saved me, I'd gladly pay the $.50. I'll be going here to deliver all my packages in the future!"

Just remember to ask for your dish with no fish sauce or egg. The spring rolls were quite good as well. Wash it all down with my favorite new drink, the Lady Boy (Thai whiskey with gingerale and lime).

    "text": "This is part 2 of my review, posted as an update to my original.\nThe fourth course was grilled ribeye steak, with quail egg (sunny side up) over forbidden wild rice with black garlic and white asparagus. The steak was cooked at what I consider the perfect temp for ribeye, about 1/2 betwen mid-rare and medium (more red than pink, and warm). I wasn't familiar with black garlic before this...it has a very deep earthy flavor and has little in common with all other garlic preparations I've had, it was quite tasty and novel (for me). The egg was cooked exactly how I like them: sunny side up, runny yolk, and slightly caramelized whites around the edges giving a crispy texture. Despite this being done in every way perfectly....it was still 2nd the pork. The pork was just that good.\nThe fifth course was cheese. I can't recall the details here, and failed to get a picture as well :( There was a semi-soft Italian cheese (my wife and Salvatore had been discussing their shared Italian heritage throughout the first 4 courses), and a firm Spanish cheese, onion relish, candied beets, and something I have completely forgotten the name of. It was kind of like a fine dining version of frosted flakes...very nicely balanced the saltiness and uniform texture of the cheeses. The onion relish was very nicely done as well, the onions still had enough texture to contrast with the cheese, but no crunch left at all. The candied beets were almost like a flexible art glass in their deep color and translucency. \nThe 5th course was dessert. Chocolate Torte, a cherry turnover, and a graham cracker ice cream. This was definitely the weakest of the 6 courses--which isn't surprising, neither my wife nor I are big dessert eaters and rarely order it. The torte was unremarkable, but well-executed. Ditto the turnover. The ice cream however was a surprise and a delight. Nicely made ice cream with a modest overrun and deep graham cracker flavor, with a few crunchy bits here and there to vary the texture.\nThis was the best meal I've ever had in a restaurant...and I eat in a lot of fine dining restaurants (though I rarely have anything other than an app + entree). I have paid a great deal more, gotten a greal deal less, and been happy about it. this was one of the best values in fine dining I've ever seen as well.\nI realize that this review is extremely positive, perhaps even gushing. I assure you I do not usually write reviews like this....I have quite a few of them on Yelp! so you can check me. I will certainly criticize when I see a need, this was just a genuinely amazing experience. \nI have uploaded photos of each course to Yelp...except the cheese course which was devoured before thinking of the camera."

I'm interested to see how they grow for sure. \nI came during Pittsburgh Restaurant Week, which meant we were able to get 5 dim sum dishes for the price of 4. Not bad, not bad. I was so pumped when I saw the tray going round and eagerly awaiting which dishes I would choose from! So the chick came round with the tray of 5 different dishes and we all grabbed them up.\nI was able to try every dim sum item on the menu. How? Because that's all the options they had. I'm not privy to how most dim sum restaurants are, but I thought there would have been more options. I'm wondering if they're starting with the five (which seem to rotate out on different days when I peaked at the menu) and expanding from there. I'm actually hoping, more than wondering!\nWhile the pork belly bites rocked my world, the others were tasty enough, like the cold soba noodles, steak tataki and shrimp salad. Looking forward to seeing what else they can come up with to rock my world 5 to 10 to 20 times more!\nI was also excited to try some of the cocktails, since I'd heard they were pretty crafty (get it, craft cocktail??). I tried the G&G Club Cocktail $10 (bourbon, amaro, creme de cassis, orange bitters). It was good and STRONG. Be careful... \nI really like how they set the main menu up, aside from the dim sum. They list the plates by size. So the top of the list is smallest and runs to largest. While the short ribs $6 (cream cheese biscuits, aged white cheddar cheese, hollandaise) were AMAZING. We split between four people, when I really wanted to shove both biscuits in my mouth. So maybe share with two people:)\nThe salmon $17 (crispy pretzel bread pudding, braised cabbage, pickled mustard seeds) on the other hand was enough for one person, but we did split, with so much other food to share. I thought this dish was very creative and loved the homemade pretzel bread and cabbage. The salmon was also expertly cooked!\nThe tasso ham flatbread $14 (black garlic, olive oil, leeks, mushrooms, fontina cheese, kale, arugula) was also very good. Actually, come to think of it, the main dishes may have been better than the dim sum... I just came to this realization after typing all this out. I feel like they set out to potentially conquer dim sum in the Burgh... and hopefully they will, but for now it seems like main dishes rule."

Once another employee came in and even they didn't speak to each other. He's just rude. \n2) Lots of ingredients are an extra charge. All you might hear is, \"that's a dollar fifty extra, that's fifty cents extra.\" Not much friendliness happening over there. East side makes it totally pleasant! I'm not sure how, but part of it is just being super friendly and they seem so happy to see you!\n3) East side is so busy they have four people behind the counter. They welcome your arrival, smile, are engaged and always have customers. They wear cool uniforms, and everyone says, \"thank you!\" As a group when they hear you leave a tip. \n4)West side uses teaspoons to serve extras, east side uses a spoon larger than a Tablespoon. So for example, I might get 6 cranberries on my Strawberry salad cause of the size of the spoon. East side? 15 cranberries. When I said something to the west side guy, he scoffed and said it would be an extra charge and east side isn't the same place. Pecans? West side a few crumbs, east side? At least 8 nice sized pecans. \nI've talked to three people so far who have the same to say about this guy and location. We all understand why the place is always empty.

It was suuuuper cute & cost as much as all of our meals but it was worth it! The waiter even made sure we took a pic/video before the poured the \"smokey\" effect. lol. You can tell this was his first go-around.\nI ordered the Fried Mac & Cheese. The sauce that it came with had a hint of sweetness & it was paired very good :) Loved it!\nTried the Spinach & Artichoke Dip which was fab & had a bite of my friends Sugar Factory Salad which I would recommend because it was perfect. It had cherry tomatoes, pieces of apples. Yummerness!\nOur waiter was super friendly & even hooked it up with wristbands to Chateau, Paris LV's club located atop Sugar Factory.\nI want to try the rest of their dessert drinks/goblets when I come back ;)"

I didn't fit the stereotype I had created in my mind....I'm not 85, I'm not rickety, and my bones don't crack every 5 min. What a fool I was-this place is for everyone in all stages of life! \nThe Dr is energetic, knowledgeable, funny and hard working. He explained how my current issue likely developed and the different actions I could take to change it. He wasn't pushy, he was empowering and educated me on how our body functions. \nThe staff are fantastic. They are flexible and accommodating with appt times which was important for me due to my work schedule. The massage chairs are tots fabulous as is the up to date selection of magazines. :) \nI would recommend this place to anyone who wants to feel better!"

I thought for a moment, 'maybe smokin hot chick knows a really good place for breakfast. Maybe smokin hot chick and I can strike up a meaningful conversation, fall madly in love with each other, and be together forever?'\n Not wanting to tempt fate and avoid ruining the happy delusion my brain had concocted, I entered. I asked the girl behind the counter about breakfast. She told me I had to go upstairs. Meanwhile, smokin hot chick quickly got a coffee and quickly walked out. My happy delusion crushed, I slowly walked up the stairs of solitude and inquired about breakfast again to the lady behind that counter. She explained the specials, and I ordered it. A croissant with ham and cheese and vegetables, a side of something and a beverage. (I went with coffee and bowl of fruit.) Total was ten and change. The fruit was obviously canned, the croissant was cold Despite being squashed in a panini press. The coffee was pretty good. AND I wasn't gonna live happily ever after with hot chick.\n It was just an ok meal. I didn't however try their bread, which looked very good. So that might redeem it if you go."

If you are looking for a \"spa casino experience,\" (high prices & faux decor), this is not the place for you. Think of it as more of a \"massage clinic.\"\nYou go in, get a very good massage, and get out. That's how I like it. No fluff, no high prices.\nThis place is clean and the people giving you the massage are very attentive to your needs. Since you are face down most of the time, does your massage feel better if you are in one of those pretty casino spas? Heck no.\nReasonable price, best kept secret in town. Come here and save your money for food & drink. For those of you that rely on pictures of the SPA, all the pictures on their website are just decorations.\nI believe in TRUTH IN ADVERTISING. It's no shame to advertise that you are set up like a massage clinic. They could get better ratings if they didn't use all those \"fake\" spa pictures on their website. Don't be embarrassed.

The coaches are nice and clean, Japanese high velocity cars plying a slow 20 mile stretch with a stop every mile w/o washroom access. Strike one!\nSingle track with trains stopping at same stations a mile apart, instead of 'A' and 'B' trains, stopping at every other one as in odd# and even#. Strike two! 40mph not 20.\nDual tracks in either direction would be a lot more efficient despite the cost, which would be recovered faster. It would command a higher fare which people don't mind paying for esp. as season pass for a more nimble system. Strike three!\nI could go on and on. I've lived in San Francisco (BART), New York and been on the El in Chicago. I've ridden on the San Diego system that's elevated on a portion of its stretch. This just does'nt compare....but it's a pacifier and provides a nice alternative to the routine drive or taking the bus. Problem is it's not 24 hours and the alignment of the corridor it plys only serves a small clientele. Strike four!\nOf course they had to run it through mid town, downtown and along the ballparks and ASU and TTL. It gives it a big town feel done in a small town way. Sure it'll be more like it ought to be, when the planned extensions are in place and ridership magically swells to record levels...but when will it connect like the Freeways are beginning to do, albeit also a bit late in the day as well.\nPlease...I'd rather not get started on the Ultra modern buses/tandems that are running devoid of passengers for the most part. If it weren't for the driver, it would be empty. All the feasibility studies etc. are a sheer waste if, we fail to run an efficient and affordable, clean system to truly move the masses as they do in so many urban areas around the world. Don't try to reinvent the wheel, it's been done,just take it the rest of the way and learn and improve what they boast and do one better, to be a model everyone will be envious of. Try harder and Good Luck! People should drive their cars because they want to once in awhile for family outings e.g. not because they have to. Period."

I'm not even a beer person and I finished it before my food came out, and seriously considered another. It's more than I'd usually spend on a beverage ($6.50) but well worth it.\nOpted for the cream of leek soup ($3 cup) and the Royale with cheese pasty ($9). Soup was smooth and creamy, flavor was pleasant and Stilton was pronounced. The bread and butter it's served with is delightful- thick, dense bread with plenty of smooth butter. \nPasty seemed to take a while, but it was worth it- stuffed full of beef, mushrooms, onions, and cheese, it really hit the spot. Gourmet Hot Pocket indeed. Crust was buttered and delicious without being too thick or getting gummy, stuffings were hot and complemented one another. Menu mentions several dips it can be served with, I didn't mention one in my order but was brought a dark reddish sauce- based on taste, I could not tell if it was a light house-made ketchup or an odd barbecue sauce, but either way I did not use much of it. Might suggest the Thousand Island as more complementary.\nService was attentive, prompt, and polite. Most of the staff is skinny white guys with tattoos and vintage clothing, and they're all surprisingly quiet but very sweet. Whoever's in charge of the music is great: went from Metric to bluesy country and it was all well-selected. \nDefinitely coming back- tempted to chill at one of their smaller tables all weekend with a banana beer and a bunch of papers to grade. Want to try the rest of their soups, and quite a few of the pastys too- as good as my meal was, I think this is a place I'll constantly be trying new things rather than sticking to one dish."

Add to that a very hard working, charming young couple, Claudio and Nadine, who are at the helm, and frankly, what's not to like?\nSimply put...at the time of this writing, this place has barely been on the map more than 3 months. It already has the whole neighborhood talking and supporting it. I saw person after person come in, pick up their food, and tell the owners that they heard about them from somebody. They don't need to advertise but I shall Yelp regardless. I can already see longevity and expansion in their future.\nAntipasto salad. Decorated with attractive rolls of excellent tasting meats and cheese. Add more shredded cheese and very crisp romaine. Top it with still warm, freshly grilled red bell pepper in olive oil. Then top it with his house balsamic dressing. Get it!\nThen make sure you sop up the dressing with slices of his own freshly baked bread. And try not to roll your eyes into the back of your head while you moan in delight.\nChicken Marsala. Tender, generous, moist chicken breast, pounded then seared to perfection, then topped with copious amounts of sautéed mushrooms in a Marsala sauce. You get to name your pasta, Mr. B chose Angel hair. An excellent choice.\nCheese Steak Deluxe. A sandwich that is destined for fame. Start with thinly sliced, tender beef and a touch of pepperoni, add well sautéed mushrooms, onions, some of those magnificent grilled red bell pepper slices, and some great melty cheese, then drop it and all its juices into one of his freshly baked Italian rolls. Juicy, flavorful, huge. Wouldn't change a thing.\nThere is no pretense to his food. He cooks with simplicity. He cooks it fresh. He loves his customers and already knows them by name. There is a very special vibe here.\nPlenty of left overs to revisit tonight's meal. And we will be back. Maybe to try a pizza from his stone oven.\nAll I can say is, if you dropped everything and ran over here now, it will not be a moment too soon, and you will be happy you did."

The sauce had interesting flavors. I really liked the cole slaw though, and the toast... I think totally unnecessary and just adds more carbs to the meal. They should offer some healthier options to that, maybe some apple slices or a side salad?\nThe overall experience was very pleasant. \nAs I said, I probably wouldn't go out of my way to go and eat there but I would definitely let friends peer pressure me in going :)"

The broth was deeply flavored and tasted like, well, like they craft their food with care and quality. The noodles were thin and had great texture, while the veggies (which change from day-to-day from what I understand) mostly peas, spinach and asparagus this time - had been slightly roasted and caramelized then cooked until crisp tender. Perfect. A friend ordered the vegetarian sukiyaki and it looked amazing - something new to try for next time.\nThe only minuses were the food took a really long time to come out of the kitchen - and the place wasn't that busy on a Sunday evening. My husband ordered the Veggie Tempura roll and while he said it was tasty, it was one of those super large sliced rolls that is so loosely packed it's impossible to pick it up with just chopsticks, or your fingers for that matter, without it completely falling apart. I didn't even try...\nOverall I highly recommend Miko's to those on a veggie forage voyage. A really, really nice stop-over on the RamenQuest™ journey."

Somehow I believe that giving them up is going to miraculously result in a 20 lb weight loss. One can always hope.\nThis year is different. After sampling these delightful confections at the DBG Chile and Chocolate Festival, I was hooked. At the time, I sampled an itsy bitsy bite of the passion fruit chocolate, I was sold. I wished I had a trunk full of disguises readily available so that I could eat each and every morsel on that tray. It was too early to buy chocolates for the holidays, but we did go to the boutique at the Montelucia a month later. I'm sure the valet appreciated parking our vehicle with it's sweet scent of our Chompie's leftovers in the back seat. \nWe selected several different boxes for ONLY the people I thought would appreciate such exquisite chocolates. Anyone that I've witnessed shoving an entire chocolate in their mouth with 2 chews at best was off the list. That left a small list which was great for me considering these pricey little gems. And despite my faint-hearted protests, my husband smartly insisted on choosing a box for me. There are actually only a handful of selections, but truthfully, the flavors are so brilliant, you will not need any more. My favorite is the passion fruit, followed closely by the French caramel truffle. I usually don't even like caramel, but this toffee covered truffle is filled with the creamiest caramel you can imagine.\nThe boutique is open every day, until 10 pm Wed-Sat!

They are as everyone says: extremely friendly, smiles everywhere, and extremely efficient. \n \nWhen I first called to scheduled the appointment, the office was closed and come to find out the Dr. Brian closed the office for a couple of days so everyone could be with their family (this is a one dentist establishment ! which I love!). \n \nTheir office is simple but done very comfortably and neat. The receptionist, Jeanette, is very friendly and takes the time to explain the specific forms, the reasons for the forms, and where to sign. While filling the forms out there were two other patients waiting. I was very surprise how quickly they received them and had them in the back since they just open literally 2 minutes after 8am. \n \nMy own wait was short, a mere couple of minutes, before Susan called for me. Susan explained at the very beginning what she will be doing with me and during each process (x-rays, measurements, cleaning, etc) she talks me through each step and what she's looking for (good or bad). My dentists in the past would do the cleaning after the exam but at Nevada Trails Dental, they did everything prior to the doctor coming in which I really like and you would think that would be more common since you'd be \"fresh and clean\" for the dentist. Susan is great even with me pestering her about whitening information. She provided me with her experience, cost, what insurance covers and why certain things aren't, and told me the pros and cons of their two options. \n \nDr. Brian was friendly, along with his staff. I was a little surprise he examined the x-ray results in his office rather with me considering how his staff talked me through everything. The time with the dentist is pretty short (I was with him for maybe 10 minutes) and I was in their office a total of 90 minutes. But during that short time, he checked my mandible for issues, did an oral cancer check, and of course check my teeth (again, the only dentist I've ever had to do all those check!). \n \nThere is one little confusion which is their hours of operation is not updated on their front door. They are open at 8am but the door still say 9am. Which through me since it was my first time and was worried I got my appointment time wrong. \n \nOverall, I'm extremely happy with my experience and glad I went to this office! ^_^"

We've never been to this building (I say building because it has been so many different restaurants over the years). I would figure this place gets plenty of traffic as it is situated right in the heart of Ballantyne. It wasn't full, though, on the Saturday night we went. In fact, I'd say only 50-75% of the seats were taken.\nWe were promptly seated and seen by a few different waiters before actually getting \"our\" waitress. I ordered ribs, my dad a hamburger, my sister chicken, and my mom salmon. After about 20 minutes, the food came out. Interestingly enough, my hand towel for my ribs came out 10 minutes before any food was served...which doesn't really make sense. \nThe food came out, and the first thing I noticed was how hard my ribs were. Usually, you can take a knife and break apart the ribs like melted butter, but this time, I had to bend back a rib, and cut it before it came apart. The meat was tough--possibly overcooked? I pointed this out, and it was quickly taken back. A new plate of ribs arrived about 15 minutes later, which was MUCH better, but still not great. While soft, there were fat nubs on the ends, and the sauce wasn't great. I think they were short ribs which are usually of lesser quality than baby back, which I was annoyed about. If I'm paying $19 for ribs (or whatever it was), I'd like good quality ribs.\nThey gave us a free dessert because of the ribs. We got the banana cream pie, which was just bad. The pie crust was not good at all, I took a bite and was done. Everyone else said their dinner was average as well.\nWould I come back? Doubtful--this place left me unimpressed."

The location is interesting because not on the casino floor of the Cosmo but on the second floor so takes some work too find it. Once you get there thinking is this really buffet because the interior screams nothing of the type. The tables not your typical all sane size two or fours or connect bunch of tables together. You have nice couch type of four tops, even have bar stool long tables, wine self service machine (least that what I could gather since non of us drank wine that night), and really nice vibe too it.\nThe food was hit or miss. There were few good things but also for all the good felt like just as much bad. The fried rice pretty much bland but like the presentation in the little chinese to go box. The yakisoba noodles were awesome. Most of the cold seafood apps was fan of from the tako salad, shrimp ceviche, shrimp with grits, and caesar salad. The craving station not fan of the pork belly (the pieces were huge chunks: besides no one at the craving station), the kalbi short ribs were just flat out fatty pieces and gross, never tried the prime rib but looked okay, and might have had something else. I enjoyed the tacos lot between the pulled pork and chicken had go back twice just for more tacos. The fresh salsa and guacamole was good. The jalapeno cornbread was tasty had too get seconds on that one. I do like the diversity with the menu between the three different areas. Dessert area that one that nothing but HIT after HIT. The gelatos, too the petite fours of rice krispies bars, macrons, and every other little dessert delight could think of they had out. So make sure you leave room for desserts when you come too Wicked Spoon. \nThis whole little sauce puts and tapa style plates. Too be fair not all of the food small portions. NOT FAN. I love the look too it! No doubt keeps you from going buffet excess cause in reality no way can fit as much on plate. But really after the second trip gets irritating so I just double stacking pots or plates save trip. \nThe service unfortunately hate too be mean but our waitress literally forgot what we order for drinks had too come back twice too make sure got it right. She took long time too get our drinks. Half the time notice she was talking too group at another table and not really playing attention too other guests. Our glasses always empty and not on it came too clearing out dirty plates. Bad service. \nIn closing say that maybe cause not fan of buffets in general.

But I could only take so much nagging and prodding and pushing from my coworker who kept whining \"I want Tokyo Lobby!\" until I finally said \"OK SHUT UP WE ARE GOING THIS INSTANT\"\nThe thing that stood out the most was the friendly staff. When my friends and I walked in, the employees all greeted us with a friendly shout. Suddenly I'm Norm from \"Cheers\"\nThe sushi was excellent! I'm still kind of a sushi noob, but as a person who doesn't really care for fish I have to say it was quite impressive. The texture was just right; not too chewy and not too squishy.\nI believe what I had was called a Glendale Roll. Baby lobster and... stuff, rolled up, battered and fried to a crisp. Delicious! Nothing like good sushi cooked to order! (Yes, it's ironic on purpose) I think all food should be battered and fried. If you see a restaurant in the future called The Battery, then odds are I'll be running the place.\nAt the time of my last visit, there was a new location being built closer to the road on the opposite end of the parking lot. I'm assuming this is to accomodate more customers as Tokyo Lobby was teeny tiny inside. Maybe it's to further distance the restaurant from the WalMart a few doors down. I say good on you, Tokyo Lobby. WalMart sucks. As of right now I don't know if it's open yet, but hopefully it will be soon. Excellent place, and I would recommend it to anyone with an appetite for sushi.\nEdit! I asked my coworker today about the status of the new building and he says it's open! I like exclamation points!"

    "text": "The only reason I'm writing this review is because of the bag check. I walked into the store, made it about halfway through the store before a cashier was yelling for my attention. I turn around and she shouts that she needs to check my bag. The bag in question is probably 12\"x12\" and doesn't fit anything wider than an iPad before it starts to visibly bulge out. I hand her my bag and receive a ticket. As soon as I turn around I see women shopping with purses bigger than mine that could have easily fit whatever they were trying to stop me from stealing. I don't want to say it was racially motivated, but two black men walking into a store and they're the only ones who have to check in a bag? I wonder if she knew that statistics show that middle aged white women (who carried their purses freely) are more likely the shoplift. Even more baffling is the fact thought of my stealing a $2.99 shirt stuffed in my LV bag. \nThankfully the manager was in reach and She promptly helped us. She retrieved the bag and apologized. She explained to the employee that backpacks were the only bags that needed to be checked in and the employee says \"Well I didn't know. No one tells me anything.\" My bag was the only bag on the counter while numerous purses and diaper bags roamed the store. \nNeedless to say several employees overheard the situation and assisted us in finding the manager. They expressed to us that she was wrong and not to argue with her., probably saving us from a more chaotic interaction. \nIn the end I didn't find anything I was interested in and left. The store was neat and had plenty of employees tending to it. Will I be back? I doubt it."

People would come in and out constantly. When we got there, we were sat down immediately. When it came down to ordering, we ordered the seafood noodle soup and crab fried rice. Although the icons on the menu signified our items were spicy, they weren't really at all. I had asked the waitress if they had anything that would make our food spicier, and the lady said no. Too bad for me...I love super spicy food. Anyway, both items tasted pretty good. I was eating hungover, and usually I don't really eat when hungover. It somewhat curbed my hungover. Thank goodness."

The ambiance of our seating was lousy, as there was a table with young children nearby (for 8 pm Saturday dinner), and loud party girls chanting over shots at the nearby bar rail. Also we were seated next to a corner so lots of people were hurrying around. Despite that, the service was great and the food was thoroughly enjoyed."

I've had one bus break down, one bus leave 10 mins early, and the very next bus was very very late.\nAlso, my main complaint is that they do not have a designated area for luggage on the 28X bus. I understand that these buses weren't made to go to the airport, but maybe they should consider having a designated Airport service bus. There's nowhere to put your suitcase, so it ends up in the walkway or taking up a seat."

I will say that we sat in the parking lot for a minute or two deciding if that's what we wanted to eat. Not that it was uninviting or dirty, just not what we expected I guess? Nevertheless, super glad we decided to stay. I was completely amazed at how good our meal was. \nWe started with the ceviche, which was some of the best I've ever had. I'm usually not a ceviche guy but this place managed to keep the citrus in check.\nI decided to order the Churrasco Salvadoreno, which is a combo plate of Carne Asada, grilled Shrimp, Chorizo, plantains and black rice and beans. I wasn't a huge fan of the chorizo (too much vinegar for my taste, but that may be normal for El Salvadorean food). The Carne Asada and Shrimp were great, and the plantains cooked to pure perfection.\nWifey had this combo appetizer with empanadas, pupusa, plantain chips, Fried Yucca and a few other things. What a great plate. \nMy son ordered the carne asada plate and my daughter had a kids meal with a cheese pupusa and rice. Overall, great great great meal.

    "text": "I have been 4 times to this restaurant and it never ceases to impress me! \nFirst, you absolutely have to get the omakase menu which is the tasting menu including 5-6 items that the chef changes accordingly to the new arrivals. And do get the places right in front of the sushi bar to be able to look at the crazy knife skills of Chef Park.\nThe most unique feature of this restaurant is how chef Antonio Park goes about to get his fish as fresh as possible. His efforts to import the fish directly from Japan while keeping it as ecologically as possible are beyond mind blowing. He uses different techniques such as acupuncture to kill the fish to maximizing its sweetness while minimizing its suffering. His sushi and sashimi dishes are unique such that the garnishes are packed with flavors without hiding the the characteristics of each fish. The presentation are incredibly visually appealing.\nApart from fish, Park also offers meat and seafood dishes. The short ribs are absolutely flabbergasting as its flavor is enhanced by its side dishes and oh-so-tender! The 1855 steak is aged for two years and served on himalayan salt block which not only adds to the wow! factor but also gives the surfaces of the meat this salty crust. His desserts are also creative, colorful and deliver an array of promising flavors and texture!\nAll in all, restaurant Park is definitely a must-try as you really cannot find any better dish fresher and tastier than his! The chef is there every single day and has such a great passion in every single dish that comes out of his kitchen! Ah and they also offer lunch and brunch on saturday. The restaurant is closed on sundays."

Indeed, Fat Tuesday just gotten Fat Saturday on that day. \nBefore I ordered, I asked to sample a \"190 Octane\" it is considered their top seller. This flavor combines orange juice and orange flavors with 190 Grain Spirits. It was actually very good! The chick at the bar was friendly and even explained about their other popular drinks, I even tipped her. The Hurricane has been my favorite flavor everywhere I go. It's rum with tropical juices. Also, I see that you can mix more than one flavor in a daiquiri drink. \nI'm in Rockstar status! So I went with the 44 Magnum. Its two flavors: 190 Octane and Hurricane put together. I wanted to downplay the sweetness and have it a notch stronger, for a dollar more I added an extra shot. It was in Yard Dog size and second to the tallest drink they offer. The drink was what I've asked for: strong, smooth, sweet. Normally, daiquiri drinks don't get me buzzed but this blend did kicked in quick! and It added a \"pep in my step\" in that SinCity Swag! \nLocated in the Miracle Mile shops in Planet Hollywood.

What used to be gourmet chicken on a budget is now a roll of the dice.\nThe confidence from my first visit seems gone. Employees seem confused; not sure whether to charge up front or when the food is done. Or what goes on a particular sandwich. The wait time has doubled. The \"wraps\" sometimes use burger buns instead of pitas. The fries sometimes come without that seasoning that worked so well. It's like a roll of the dice with your twenty dollar bill on the line.\nWhere is that Charcos we were first enthralled with?

Then I saw their sign that they had an all you can eat dinner and I got really excited!\nAnybody that knows me knows that I can eat. And if your offering me all you can eat im going to be there for a whole. And since I hadn't eaten all day I was ready. I sat at the sushi bar where they told me everything on the menu was available on the all you can eat with the exception of the sashimi. \nThere were 5 people behind the counter at the sushi bar and they cranked out the food really fast. But it didn't taste rushed and it certainly didn't taste like all you can eat. In fact it might of been true bast sushi I've ever had. \nThere was one sushi chef that took care of me almost entirely. I'm sorry I didn't get his name because he have me great service as did everyone else I came on contact with. \nSo to sum it up if you live in Vegas or are visiting (it's only about 10-15 minutes from the strip) you must try it.

The novelty of this place is that you get your sushi for a revolving conveyer belt! And they've spaced is so that it goes throughout the restaurant. Good for allowing people seated at booths to also access the belt, bad for if you want a certain type of sushi and need to wait for it to roll all the way around again...\nI will say upfront that the quality is not the best. And over the years, I think the rolls have gotten smaller... And sometimes you don't know how long those rolls have been sitting out on the conveyer belt, waiting for someone to take them. On the plus side, the popular rolls are replenished quite frequently so those are always freshly made. You can even order from the chefs if there's something you want that's not on the belt. \nAnd the prices can't be beat! From $1 for the cheapest, and $2 for the most expensive, the sushi comes on plates of 2-4 rolls. This is probably the best bang for your buck if you want to try a variety of different rolls. I always end up getting full on less than $10, which is pretty cheap for sushi!"

    "text": "Finally, I can Yelp about an apartment complex. Now that I no longer live here, I feel compelled to Yelp about the Mandarina. \nFirst off, I hate leases. I hate apartment complexes. I hate paying deposits and being treated as if I'll do damage before I ever move in. I'm no messy criminal. Good thing for me, the Mandarina staff treated me as if I were the mature, responsible and nice adult I am (for the most part). \nOf course, you think, \"They have to do that while they're trying to get you to sign.\" Well, even after I signed a lease and moved in, the staff were helpful, considerate and friendly. I can honestly say that. And believe you me, I've had my run in's elsewhere with some pretty crabby management. \nEach month when it was time to pay rent, the staff made me a copy of my check and signed and dated it. Ah-ha. Proof, I thought. I never needed it, nor did I need to worry about getting my security and pet deposit back. After I moved out and cleaned my place, I did one final walk-through with the staff. I knew that day whether or not I'd be charged for anything. I wasn't, and my happy refund found its way to me in a matter of days. \nSo, how was living there? Were there any problems? Of course there were. It is, after all, an apartment complex. You can't really choose your neighbors, although for a time, I lived next to some really cool guys who played football. I was sad to see 'em leave. \nGuest parking is a joke. Most of the parking is covered and reserved for residents, so any guest that comes over must come early enough to find a spot, or be okay with hoofing it from somewhere else. I guess you could always park in the Castle Boutique across the street. \nLet's talk gym/pool. I used both on a regular basis, especially the gym. It was always clean with fresh towels and cold water. The cardio machines aren't anything to brag about, but I sure did love having free weights at my disposable, along with a couple weight benches and leg presses. Plus, here's where you'll find a vending machine if you need your soda fix. As for the pool, I wouldn't say it's the cleanest since it's publicly shared. I didn' t see many people using it during the week, so I took advantage of after-work swims. You can have open containers, too, which is nice if you want to relax with a brew. Just don't ignore the pool rules. No glass allowed. I found out that! \nInside, across from the gym, is what they call a Business Center. It has two computers with Internet access. You can check your email or Myspace 24/7 without too much of a wait. I wouldn't suggest saving your passwords or personal documents on the desktop, but I certainly ran across my fair share of interesting things... People who aren't moderately tech savvy should probably not use public computers. In any case, getting to the computers is easy. Sometimes you have to wait, for people bogart the machines. I guess it comes with the territory. \nHere comes my gripe. Maintenance - both interior and exterior. I never once had my single call for maintenance answered. I un-clogged my own bathtub and said \"to hell with it\" regarding the broken ice machine. Whatever. I found you can't really rely on this place to fix things, unless they're absolutely necessary. As for the landscaping, it's okay. I don't understand why they water the grass and trees every night, creating a swampland. Makes no sense to me. Nor will I ever be a-okay with landscapers waking me up at 6:30 a.m. to trim hedges. \nBut, looking back over the 12 months I lived there, I have to say 98% positive things to say about Mandarina. They are a bit overpriced, but if you can afford it, it's a pretty good place to live, especially since you'll get your own Washer and Dryer in your unit. \nThe location is great if you don't mind being nestled around business parks and buildings. There's places to eat at Priest/Washington and 48th/Washington. You'll have easy access to the 202 and 143 also. The light rail runs right in front of the complex, so that can be a plus or minus, depending on how you look at it. At first, I was thrilled. Then I found out that the light rail won't stop at the Mandarina. So, I figured, why stick around when I can't play with the new city toy? That, and I refused to pay higher rent."

Almost everyone else in my party ordered steaks. I tried the filet and it was very tender, but unevenly cooked. Everyone commented that their steak was either overlooked or undercooked. We didn't figure it out until the end that they must have switched up all our orders - a detrimental mistake. My poor little cousin got my boyfriend's rare+ steak. At the end he said it sucked cause his cow was still bleeding! We were pretty upset at this point, but there wasn't much we could do. My sister ordered a steak with foie gras on the side and it was horrible. Nothing like foie gras I've had before. The sides were good.\nLike most restaurants with an amazing view, the food was just ok. I'm glad I came here once to see the view, but I wouldn't come again. There is also a lounge above the restaurant. So if you want to see the view without splurging $50-80 per entree for dinner, ride the elevator straight to the lounge! You can also go outside where there are telescopes and rides. \nThey had a photographer come around and take pictures for us, which I thought was cool! I thought they would post it somewhere, but silly me! Of course they are for sale. Guess how much a picture costs?? $60!!!"

The worst service I've ever had in any restaurant was at the Original Pancake House, and I explore food establishments on several continents. But I still go back once in a while for their crepes. Not letting me and my girl sit in a booth because we're only 2 people is also ridiculous. It's the end of the day and there's plenty of room. Being overly pedantic for no reason is not the way to treat people. Especially not when you're charging them $5 for a side of 2 strips of bacon. That being said, the service this time was still much better than previous experiences with them."

This gives it an interesting feel and also filters out much of the crowd you might get at a place on Mill or elsewhere during the Fall semester (the busiest). \nYou just have to get the beer flight when you come in. It's a fine representation of what the bar serves. Also drinking tiny beers seems to get you drunk faster!\nThe owner here is a great guy but is probably the most frank, least appealing person I've ever met. He doesn't follow sports (he says he has no affiliations with teams. which normally wouldn't be a problem, but we're in Tempe! Just suck it up and be a Devils fan!) but always has the latest event on one of the 7 or so LCD screens so us Sporties can indulge. \nDespite lacking in the sports knowledge department he really knows his shit when it comes to his beers. I think his name is Carl or something, and he would be the first to tell you that he is a beer snob. You can see his brew setup as a massive backdrop to the bar. Luckily Carl balances out his abrasive yet lovable personality with some super cute girls, definitely a good move. \nThey have food here sometimes (food trucks that are out front) and a sort of limited food menu that the employees add things to every once in a while. There is a \"soul food\" truck and a \"shinobu taco\" truck outside on certain days, although I'm not entirely sure what days these are. \nThere are board games galore for people who get bored just chatting, and a free popcorn setup you can poke at to your heart's delight. \nThe Leg Humper Hefeweizen is my favorite."

We were helped by a very pleasant sales associate named Aimee. She was very knowledgeable, friendly and she wasn't pushy at all. She showed me all the purses I was interested in and gave me her honest opinion. I went in thinking I was dead set on a specific purse but she helped me change my mind and it was definitely for the better.. I ended up getting the Speedy Bandouliere in the LV monogram in size 30 (the leather strap is worth the extra $$$).. And I couldn't be happier with it.. While finalizing my sale a few Korean tourists fell in love with my purse and wanted to get 1 too but I got the last one sooo BOOOYA haha If they don't have the purse you want they will call around and ask for you.. There are 6 LV stores in Las Vegas so you're bound to find your perfect purse at one of the locations. Anyways they wrapped my purchase up all pretty and out the door I was on my happy way to lunch~ \nLove this location at the Forum Shops and thank you so much Aimee for all your help & of course thanks to my man hehe~ \nHOT TIP: Definitely keep your receipt: If anything goes wrong with your zipper they will repair it for you free of charge for the first 2 years and also if you find a defect in the stitching they will exchange your purse for you... But they say they 100% stand by their products so that shouldn't happen."

So this is the nearest bar to us and thus by default has become our local. And a very nice local it has turned out to be. It's a good 25 min walk from the house (we refuse to drive - ain't no designated drivers in this family. Beer means too much), and on getting there we really did have the coldest, most refreshing beer in Chandler yet. The atmosphere is pleasant and the prices are good. We ordered just starters (american portions are HHUUUUUUUGGGGEEEE!!!!) so over time i'm sure we will be able to work up to a main. The pictures of the food in the menu don't look too hot - but gladly the food came out looking prettier than the picture. Tasted yum too. TV's aplenty, nice spacing between tables so not crowded, service great - they have the good balance balance between ignoring you completely and babysitting you. We never had to chase our server for a beer - she asked when we were nearly finished. (Of course we said yes). I always measure a bar on weather you would feel comfortable sitting alone with a book, a pint and your thoughts - so Uncle Bears gets a tick for that. We will surely be back - and the trek home burns off a few pints so it's sure healthier than an Irish local."

I recommend it.\nVietnamese Spring Rolls- Nothing fancy here\nCalamari- Very good, it tasted very fresh.\nBeef Panang Curry- We always order this when we do Thai. We were not impressed.\nChicken Pad Thai- Pretty good. We nearly finished it.\nDeep Fried Banana w/ Coconut Ice Cream- Had strawberries in it. I liked it, but I don't think I'd order it again... It was really good, just very sweet!\nPros:\n * There is an extensive menu that is separated Thai & Vietnamese ( I liked the layout)\n * Lunch specials available. Decently priced. \n * Lychee Drink. Yes this is a plus! I love Lychee!!\n * Good sized portions\n * Attentive server. \n * I loved the Thai Coffee here. \nCons:\n * I noticed there were spring rolls on the Vietnamese menu, but the server pointed out the spring rolls on the Thai side of the menu. He insisted I order that instead... if I'm not mistaken, it was a dollar more? I just found that a bit confusing.\n * The beverages were a bit over-priced. Nearly $3 each for Thai Coffee and Lychee.\n * Panang Curry. We were not impressed. In Lilly's defense, the veggie cuts in the Panang Curry were larger than usual and did have a more fresh taste. It's just that it was not as flavorful when in comparison to other places where we had this dish.\nTips:\n * Make sure to eat your Calamari while its still hot. It doesn't taste as great after it gets to room temperature (I've never had this problem when ordering Calamari elsewhere). Also if you want a lemon wedge with your Calamari, you'll have to ask for it.\n * The dessert was big enough for 2 to share. \n * I know some Thai restaurants use a 1-10 scale for level of heat, but at Lilly's they just ask if like it mild, medium, or hot. Just a heads up.\n \nOverall, I plan on coming back. I liked nearly everything we ordered and I'm anxious to try out the rest of the restaurant's offerings (maybe next time, I'll focus more on the Vietnamese side of the menu). A place where you can order both Pho and Pad Thai... I'm a fan!"

And as big as it was, it did fill up quite quickly, which shows its popularity.\nDrink prices seemed average and service was fast (earlier in the evening) but the waitresses that came around seemed to be pretty efficient. I have a group of 17 people spanning 2 tables on the patio, and everyone seemed really happy and having a good time. Next time I am back in town, if Kelly's is around (and by the looks of it I would assume so) I'll probably make it my group meetup again."

The Ice Lounge was no exception. $25 gets you in with one drink, $35 gets you two. All of the packages let you use the coat, boots and gloves so you are basically just deciding how drunk you want to get. There is a VIP package for $75 that includes a fancy fur jackets instead of the basic jacket (upgrading to these costs additional if you don't get the VIP package) and a photo package I believe... Locals, make sure you request the $5 discount! \nThe manager that rang us up informed us that the weeks before Christmas are typically the slowest time of year for Minus 5, so not only was it not crowded at all when we went, but ALL of the ice had just been redone a few days prior... This meant no dirty, dingy ice like some reviewers mentioned. The downside is that they had not replaced the boob luge, I was disappointed that I wasn't able to take a shot out of a nipple made of ice. Hopefully the boob luge makes a comeback!\nThe lounge is on the smaller side but it's ALL ice. The seats, the chandeliers, the tables, the shot glasses... Everything except the floor and at times, that still felt a little slick. When we went that had a huge bear made of ice and also a little snowman dressed as Santa that you could stick your head through for photos... The official policy is no cameras allowed but if you are sneaky you may be able to get away with snapping a couple. Otherwise there is an employee there to take photos for you...\nThe bartender Nick was awesome... He definitely made a good time even better! As another reviewer said, Minus 5 is about the experience, not the drinks. They weren't the best I ever had, they weren't that cheap... but we had a great time drinking them!"

We snagged an open table, but people who showed up just ten minutes after us had to wait. The front area of the restaurant looks pretty nice, though we felt cramped at our table in the back. \nAs a waffle fiend, I had to try the Liege waffle, with the seasonal fruit topping, apple and cranberry. I ordered it as a prix fixe meal, with potato strudel as my side and a mimosa. I liked the crystallized sugar which gave the waffle a little crunch, but the waffle was sort of dry. The fruit topping was tasty, though. The potato strudel was okay, but not that remarkable. My brother had the moules with the tomato-fennel broth. It looked like he could use more bread to mop up the broth--he resorted to using an empty shell as a scoop once he finished the piece of bread. Our server didn't check on us after our dishes arrived, so my brother couldn't even ask for a spoon.\nOther people's egg dishes looked good, so I'd probably go that route if I were to come back for brunch--but I don't feel a burning need to return."

I realized that a lot of customers now enjoy their traditional Japanese food, but I am such a big fan of teppanyaki, I couldn't help but sit at the teppanyaki tables!\nBetween a party of two, we shared:\nOysters: Half a dozen of really sweet and fresh oysters! \nOh Toro, Chu Toro, Giant Clam, and Sweet Shrimp sushi - everything was amazingly fresh. I personally though the Oh Toro was too fatty for my taste. I will be sticking with Chu Toro and normal Tuna from now on. The sweet shrimp sushi was amazing. They usually have live amaebi as well, where they fry the heads, but they ran out that night. =( \nOne of my favorite sashimi is lobster sashimi! We got a whole lobster of sashimi and it was seriously too much food for two people! It came out in a wonderful presentation and it costed $98 for 1.5 oz! \nFor teppanyaki, I don't think much has changed from Okada. A lot of the chefs have worked there for close to 10 years. I have tried the Kobe beef before, but this time, I just got the Surf and Turf. I believe it was $145 per person. It came with a lot of steak and lobster. There were two options for beef: either sirloin or tenderloin. I personally liked the sirloin better. The beef was really tender. There was SO much food. We basically took an entire order of the Surf and Turf to go. MY FAVORITE PART WAS THE FRIED RICE. SOO GOOD!! \nFor drinks we got the Mizumi Blue and Sinatra Smash, both were amazing!"

The bagel was perfectly resistant to the teeth before yielding it's fresh grainy goodness.\nMy decaf was fine. Nothing notable about the coffee good or bad. Service was friendly and accommodating. The large pastry display had some very delicious looking baked goods. I'll be back."

Mon adolescence a été truffée d'une bonne dizaine de passages au fameux Labyrinthe du Hangar 16, qui soit dit en passant, est véritablement un ancien hangar du Vieux-Port bâti dans les débuts du XXe siècle (1910). J'y suis même allé plusieurs fois au cours de la même année! On est loin du temps où je collectionnais obsessivement les revues Safarir, qui étaient gratuitement offertes à la sortie!...Pfff!... La thématique a bien changé depuis; à vrai dire, elle change annuellement et demeure d'actualité. Du temps où j'y allais, il était question de découvertes mystérieuses et d'invasions clandestines... L'année 2010 traitait de la fin du monde et des prédictions de Nostradamus (S.O.S Terre) où les 4 éléments constituant la planète (eau, terre, feu, air) avaient un rôle à jouer dans le dénouement du parcours. Que nous réservera l'année 2011? Ça reste à voir : c'est que le centre n'est pas ouvert à longueur d'année: seulement de mi-mai à fin octobre.\nLe principe du déroulement de jeu en soi est assez simple et n'a pas changé : vous devez le plus rapidement possible parcourir un labyrinthe ayant son contexte bien défini, au cours duquel il vous faudra résoudre des énigmes et traverser des obstacles, rien de très abstrus et fatiguant, mais n'empêche qu'il faut être en mesure de courir, se glisser, se pencher et réfléchir, évidemment. Les jeunes s'en tirent normalement entre 1h et 1h30. Justement, parlons-en; bien que la jeunesse soit le public cible, les adultes ont droit à l'accès, même que si j'en juge d'après mes expériences à l'époque, mes parents s'étaient faits un fun fou!! À vrai dire, je me demande comment ce fait-il que je n'y sois pas encore retourné!..\n-Plusieurs privilèges pour le fêté (admission gratuite, T-shirt, etc.)\n-Spécial Halloween avec lampes de poche chaque année (9 au 31 octobre)\n-Forfaits groupes\n Coûts d'entrée : 15$ et moins, tout dépendant du group d'âge auquel vous appartenez."

I love that it's around the corner from the dog park - it's perfect because I can take Minnie to the dog park to play and call my order in as I'm leaving and it's usually ready when i arrive.\nI've been a handful of times and always done take-out. It's really not the type of place you want to stay and hang out. There is no atmosphere and it's located in a strip-mall. Since the tag line is \"A Healthy Food Bistro,\" I feel like it's healthier for me than other Chinese in the valley... but I think that's just in my head! Still, I tell them 'light oil' whenever I order. I feel less guilty that way!\nUnfortunately, I'm not a big fan of the protein options. First time around, I ordered shrimp with veggies - the shrimp did not taste fresh so I picked around it and ate the veggies and brown rice. I went with chicken the next few times, and when I saw that they have eggplant (my fave) on the menu, I started requesting a combo of eggplant, mixed veggies, and chicken. Still, the chicken tastes almost processed - Once again, I eat the veggies and rice. Maybe the key is to order beef or tofu... I'll keep trying until I get it right, or maybe I'll just have to find an alternative. \nEither way, China Lite gets 3 stars from me. If you go, get the eggplant - that's the only item I can really recommend!"

GOOD TIMES.\ni don't wanna give away too much(yes there is so much more i'm not mentioning, as to not give it away, to experience on your own)but it is a different experience, one i can bet the moon you wont regret).

The service is always top notch and the lemonade is fresh and very good. I like that they have call ahead seating here so that we dont have to wait long on busy nights and the atmosphere is very Scottsdale and the price isn't cheap but it is a nice place to take a date (or in my case my lovely wife).

Lobster bisque, lobster pot pie, grilled lobster, lobster mac & cheese, lobster ravioli, lobster salad... if it's got lobster, chances are I'm going to like it. In a way, it's kind of like bacon. You can add it to just about anything and it instantly makes a dish better. So, when I heard Not Your Average Deli had lobster rolls I was excited to try one. Now, I'm not talking about lobster 'sushi' rolls... I'm talking about a sandwich roll filled with a lobster/mayonnaise mixture. I've never had a true New England lobster roll but have had a few in Maryland so I had a little bit of an idea of what to expect.\nNYAD is located on Sunset just north of the 215 and off of Decatur in the same strip mall as Phat Phrank's. It's a small space that has few decorations except for a few nets with lobsters lining the walls and a few pictures. It definitely has that New England vibe in a sort of minimalist way.\nAs for the food... well, the lobster roll was very tasty but it was a little smaller than what I expected. For $11.99 I was hoping for a large sandwich overflowing with lobster. Instead I got what amounted to a 5 or 6 inch sub with a decent, but not mind-blowing, amount of lobster. I devoured it in a couple minutes and it still left me hungry. It's also served with fries (which were delicious) and cole slaw.\nThey do get extra points for making a half sandwich for my son (for $3.59) even though they don't have a kids menu. They were more than happy to accommodate him instead of forcing me to buy a whole sandwich for him. His ham and cheese was really good -- sliced ham with american cheese on wheat bread that was grilled.\nI would definitely consider coming back to try other sandwiches or even have the lobster roll again. But for that price it's not something I would do often, just when I'm in need of a lobster sandwich fix.\n3.5 stars"

OH DEAR GOD. \nLet me paint you a word picture people. You walk into this little hole-in-the-wall type place by being drawn like a moth to a light with a HUGE white awning from the street. You pass some quaint outdoor seating and enter into a somewhat confusing maze to find some of the main seating and the bar. Rich wood surrounding you as it melts you into relaxation before you even reach the bar at the back of the establishment. You explore this tightly packed place by walking down some stairs to another bar, which I am going to call \"the speak easy\" with white lounge seating in an intimate space that exudes class. Candles lit and people chatting.\nComing back upstairs, My buddy and I had some cocktails and steak sandwiches in what I call the \"Middle Al Capone room\" The reason I say that is because I imagine Al Capone sitting in the corner of this all wood room underneath the small little wall lamps with a stogie and a cognac relaxing after a hard day of moonshine running... Soothing lighting throughout with small intimate booths with some close friends. This is it... Probably going to be my new favorite place...."

I love the stools and wall tables, nice and quaint. This place is meant to pick up a waffle, mingle for a little bit, then be on your way. It is NOT A RESTAURANT, so don't expect there to be multiple tables and lots of space to your leisure. Perhaps they will have outdoor seating when the temperatures rise, but you have to pay the city that.

Also, he made me the wrong drink and didn't even suggest he would correct it for me. Three times I've come and had issues with the way he makes things.

Not that there isn't a little frontin' and narcissistic booty-shaking going on, but it feels very balanced and chill, because everyone else is either lounging in beat-up wooden booths, hanging out in a laid back fashion on the patio, or tucked away in an intimate corner somewhere.\nIt's also a place where alot of people pass through on their way to somewhere else for the evening, and is nestled against an upscale hotel- so if you're into people watching, there are always fresh faces.

Confused, I called Cox and they proceeded to tell me because his phone's \"prefix\" is registered in Mesquite, NV (literally 40 minutes away from Vegas) that it's considered long distance, even though it's 702 and the phone was purchased IN Vegas at the Meadows Mall. This is absolutely the most ABSURD thing I've ever heard. Cox would NOT work with me, passed the buck saying they don't make the calling rules, and basically told me to eat it and pay the bill.\nUnbelievable after being a loyal customer for two years, paying over $100 every month with NO late payments. You know a business is scummy when you pay your bill, and then five days later, you receive the next month's bill in the mail already! Get real.\nUnruly, rude, disgusting scum bag of a company. Terrible in every way. Whomever privately owns this pig should be ashamed of themselves."

I've lived close to this restaurant for a few years now and have yet to try it due to the reviews but decided to go for it this morning. \nI was searching on yelp for some delivery and this place popped up. Yelp offered the option to place the order on my iPhone app so I went ahead and ordered. I was able to place the order very easily and it have me a window of about 45min to an hour which I was fine with. Since this place is right around the corner from me I did follow up after an hour had passed just to check on the status. I was less concerned with the time and just wanted to make sure the order went through since I haven't ordered on my yelp app yet. \nI was greeted by a women on the other line who must have been having a bad day. I don't even think I was greeted with a hi or hello... Just beach cafe. I informed the women I ordered on yelp and wanted to see if everything went through, and when I could expect it. She began to tell me I couldn't have done that because they don't offer it... Well if your reading this review you well know there is an option for placing an order. I politely told her there was an option and I ordered a few items and have already been charged for it. She continued to tell me I was wrong in a rude tone and then asked where I lived to which she mentioned someone just left to deliver it. I thanked her for checking and also told her she should take a look on yelp to see the option offered since it got them business. \nWhen the delivery guy came I showed him the yelp app with the delivery option and informed him of my experience with the women on the phone. He apologized and the only thing I do feel bad about is I wish I would have given him a bigger tip than what I left originally but the women really bothered me with her rude/condescending tone. You would think after so many similar poor reviews these people might make an effort to change their ways. \nOverall the good was good and I would like to give this place another shot and re-review at a later date to see if maybe I just caught this place on a bad day...."

HUSTLE!\" \nWhenever people are trying out KBBQ for the first time, they always make the same observation: \"So you're telling me I am paying money to cook for myself AND serve myself?\" You are, indeed! \nThe thing about Honey Pig is that the servers will actually place the meat on the grill for you, but the actual cooking is up to you. So if you are two people like we were in the conversation above, it doesn't leave too much time for conversation because you are too busy cooking, chewing, timing, grabbing, flipping, drinking, etc. Notice how \"waiting\" is not one of the above? AIN'T NOBODY GOT TIME FOR THAT. Since the servers are putting the meat (+ kimchi, bean sprouts, and onions) on the grill for you, there's not a lot of freedom to pace the cooking process. \nMy friend and I opted for AYCE, so each round just seemed rushed. The only time anything was NOT was in the beginning, when we asked for water - they said OK, and then forgot - and at the end, when we asked for the check - they said OK, and then forgot. Hmm. So perhaps not the best first and last impression."

I ordered my 1/3 pounder from Juan well done and it was fresh beef and seasoned with salt/pepper it seemed. Good sesame buns and a solid order of onion rings (its from a bag, but a gourmet bag at least). Condiment bar was well stocked and it was a great burger with a unique ordering experience and atmosphere. Unless your at Behihana, you never get to interact with the cook, so now if he didn't make it well done. I can give up it right back, but it was. so no problem.

The decor is similar to Fleur de Lys except they removed the thick drapes which now means you're dining with a loud view of what's outside the restaurant. The wall of roses is gone. And they've put up a tacky painting of a big breasted blonde Barbie woman on the back wall. Distracting.\nService was mediocre at best. There were only a few waiters (who never introduced themselves). Service at Fleur de Lys was a hundred times better. \nAnd of course, the food. We ordered 5 dishes, which included one entree. Lobster Mac and cheese (okay, but nothing like what amazing taste you'd expect with the combo). \nManchego salad (really arugula but where's the manchego??). \nChicken croquettes (tasteless, almost like fish sticks). \nSkirt steak with chimichurri (bland, my husband makes better chimichurri!). \nBranzino with a chorizo risotto (risotto was okay, but Wynn buffet's risotto was better).\nHUGE DISAPPOINTMENT for $60/person.

The drinks are expensive so I suggest you fill up on something first before going in.

I went there 3 times in a week and saw the same group of women there, They were always topless while a quater of the other ladies were not. Just my thoughts. \nThe place gets crowded so come early and secure a place to sit. The crowd is 3/5 guys and 2/5 ladies. Thats better then I expected. When men hear topless, I would assume they flock to those locations like flies to honey. \nWord from the wise. Don't ever let that water touch your face. You do not want that water getting in your mouth or any other facial oriface. There is a restroom at the club but its rarely used. So you know that pool has loads of urine in it.

Pulling into the parking lot I noted it is in a strip mall next to a Little Caesar's and across from a DQ, so I did not expect Muramoto level sushi. I think to honestly rate this restaurant it must be based on how well they do what they do. And for roughly $6 entrees and around $8-10 for a sushi roll, I don't feel I was paying too much for what I got. I do think the comparison can be made to the Japanese restaurant in the mall as the dishes are pretty much the same type and all served the same way in a styrofoam container. I ordered the green dragon roll, which is on par with most \"express\" places. So so flavor, good size portion and what I would get for the same price more or less at Whole Foods or Metcalfs. I also tried the teriyaki beef, which I found to be similar to the mall fast food restaurant except that it lacked flavor and was not the rich teriyaki taste I was hoping for. It was however a very large portion. In addition, the staff is very friendly and the restaurant appeared clean. \nTo sum it up, I disagree with giving this restaurant a low score based on an unreasonable expectation of obtaining excellent sushi at a strip mall sushi express, however I also do not feel that in comparison to other similar fast food locations this deserves 5 stars. I will likely not return, as it is not to my taste, but if you are looking for fast food Japanese and do not want to go to a mall, this place will do just fine."

They tell me they always suggest a reservation....so i proceed to see if they have anytime available for 8 o clock that evening. They do...Great!! I head over to Sutra which is the \"new\" sushi place to go to in scottsdale. Excited to try some new sushi in town we walk in to an 80% empty restaurant wondering why they suggested we make a reservation?? The restaurant looked identical to the previous lounge that occupied this space, La Rouge. There were minimal changes and the same furniture remained which i thought was disappointing. I thought they would have given Sutra its own identity. They might as well had called it La Rouge and told people they now serve sushi. The next disappointing thing about Sutra was the service....BRU-TAL!! Im talking painful to sit through. The waitress came over and introduced herself and asked if we wanted drinks. We wanted to see their wine list along with the martini list. She had to make two seperate trips to find both of these menus. Finally she delivered the menus to us as if they were the only menus in the restaurant and we were lucky to have received them. Then, after looking over the sushi menu for 20 minutes and finally deciding on what we wanted, the waitress came over to look over our order and make sure she was aware of everything we wanted. After she looked it over she asks, \":Oh, did they tell you what the deal was tonight??\" We all looked at each other and said, \"No, whats the deal here tonight?' She says, \"We are not serving any hot food tonight and any of the sushi that contains tempura (a fried breading) is not available, however, edamame and miso soup are still available. Hmmm....\"Why didnt they mention that when i made a reservation\" I pondered. And why didnt the server mention this the first three times she visited our table for that matter. Half the items that we ordered were immediatly eliminated and we had to go back to the drawing board and figure out what we wanted. Finally, we decide and the waitress takes our order. As the night progressed the service and experience just got more interesting. The food was brought out by runners and the waitress had no clue what had been brought out and what hadnt. She was asking US what still needed to come out. Kinda weird...thought that was her responsibility to know what still needed to come out?? So after eating a few mediocre rolls of sushi we all decided that we were full and couldnt eat anymore. We asked the server to cancel the last two dishes that hadnt arrived yet. She looked at us like we were from Mars and said, \"Oh, you guys didnt get everything?\" She canceled the remaining dishes and proceeded to talk to us for literally a half hour. \"About what\" you are wondering. I have no clue...all i know is that i felt 1000 times dumber after she was done. So, I think you get the idea. This place should live about as long as La Rouge did...and hopefully not that long. This was a painful dining experience. Very disappointing coming from the people that own Barcelona and Danny's car washes. This dinner was more annoying than the guys at the car washes that ask you if you want your windshield repaired everytime you go to fill up! SUCKED...Dont go!"

The green corn tamale was bone dry - it was obvious even before I put it in my mouth - the corn husk looked like it had never seen a drop of water. My guess is that instead of steaming it to heat it up, they had just baked it or even worse, nuked it.\nThe best dishes seemed to be the soups - Alex's posole had the right color to it and my albondigas contained some tasty pillowy-soft meatballs.\nI don't think Susie's is any cheaper than most of the other Mexican joints I've been at.

Mexican food is in general cheap (depending on how much decor you're willing to give up), so the deciding factor is in the taste which Susie's, unfortunately, did not especially shine at."

Talk about a surprise!\nThe in-laws threw us a very memorable rehearsal dinner filled with lots of different appetizers, salad, juicy steak, fluffy mashed potatoes, and way too many strong strong drinks. The hosts were nice, the bartender was friendly, we got to keep some cool cowboy hats, and were dragged to their in-town prison for photos and an arrest warrant for \"gettin' hitched.\" There might have been a mechanical bullride at the end of the night and I recall riding around on a children's wooden horse but like I said, the drinks were flowing and it was our rehearsal dinner so why not? Huzzah! Lots of out-of-state and out-of-country friends and family all had a lovely time out here in the desert and it was great times.\n5-stars for the funnest rehearsal dinner ever! Although really... don't wear heels to this place while blindfolded. It was such a work-out!"

Hidden in broad daylight right off of Indian School and 44th street, the only thing that shows you it's there is the owl (their logo) light in the window. You'll be greeted by an old gentleman who will let you into the parking lot and then you enter through a door into a windowless bar. Sounds shady right? Well, it's just shady enough to make it a little exclusive! You certainly wouldn't drive by it and decide to stop by. You have to know about it. \nThis bar is trendy divey at its finest. Logs wallpaper the walls, and the lighting is dim. There's plenty of seating either at high top tables or booths. The bar has plenty of seating as well. But the best part is the back room. The back room is filled with fun games! Games that include skeeball, shuffle board and darts! If only they had air hockey and big buck hunt. It provides a fun atmosphere and one that's chill. This bar is well put together and well kept, but still holds on to the divey feel...without beer stained floors! \nPS - they also own The Westerner that just opened in Old Town."

It is now a mediocre taco joint, but Manzetti's, in its glory days (before the waitresses were wearing hot pants and belly shirts) was my family's go-to place for reliable, consistently delicious food. Nothing TOO fancy, but a nice meal, nonetheless. Sadly, Manzetti's closed. And that is where Bricktop's falls into place. It has become a default, your old buddy, arm around the shoulder kind of place. \nI have truly never ordered or tasted anything from this menu that wasn't good. I am partial to the artichoke appetizer. Some might call me a forager-I'll take it. Served with melted butter and an aoili sauce. But the leaves are perfectly seasoned alone! \nYou can't go wrong with any of their salads (ahi tuna, peanut chicken, crab/avocado). They are so flavorful and leave you with just enough room to split the Tollhouse cookie dessert served in a cast iron skillet. This is the best dessert in Charlotte and I don't care what anyone else says. \nYou do have to ask for bread, but ask for it! It's heated to order and so good! I have tried several other entrees and I just can't say a negative thing. The blue cheese burger, the steak frites, trout amandine, salmon, thin and crispy flatbread. \nBrunch is a stand out as well. The deviled eggs with sugared bacon. Yes. A variety of eggs benny, my boyfriend's favorite Chicken and Waffles (whoever said that crispy fried chicken and sweet maple syrup don't go together is a liar). \nAtmosphere is a bit like a fancy Applebee's, but it's what's on the inside that counts, right?!"

It has a half chicken, half rack of ribs and two sausages plus two sides. The soup was the only thing that was really good. The chicken was dry and the sausages were over cooked and crispy. They have a deal for $7.77 which is a half rack of ribs and 12 wings.

It seems they are still working out exactly what the more permanent menu will be, so they're using the chalkboard to try things out before they get official menus printed.\nThe food was fantastic, and not what you would expect from a gluten free restaurant. I had the Kale & Garlic crepe and it was filling and very, very tasty. I also tried their fried pickles which were absolutely spot-on. The batter was crispy and perfectly fried, and the pickle was great as well. Again, surprisingly good for gluten free. I also like that they have a number of vegan items on the menu, because I know vegan/gluten free is a really tough market to find food in, and this really hits a great niche market that needed good food.\nOne thing I saw on the menu that I liked is they offer one of their soups on a \"pay what you want\" scale, with everything over $4 going to a different charity each month. Very cool concept.\nAt the moment they are cash-only, which I think could end up being a difficulty. But they're open in L'ville on Mondays which is a really big bonus. I am really glad these guys opened and plan on going back again in the future. I'll update as they get on their feet. I did hear they aren't planning the official \"grand opening\" until closer to spring, and that right now they're trying a soft open just to test things out and see how a gluten free menu will go over. I think they'll be great once they get the little kinks worked out."

There weren't even a lot of people, but the waitresses still took a long time to give us water, food, tea, and.. everything. They really need to hire more people during busier hours.

Upon arrival, our party of 4 was ushered to the bar area for what was supposed to be a 10 minute wait. 45 minutes later, our table was ready. Needless to say, we were ready to eat. Only a waiter never materialized. Odd, considering all the staff floating about. Another 10 minutes without any staff interaction and we were on to plan 'b'. Thank you Four Seasons and Mesa Grill for saving the evening!"

I was told about Rollin' Smoke Barbeque about a week ago and I have been wanting to try it since. I can check that off the list now. I went with a co-worker, the very same man who told me about it in the first place. Immediately upon my exit of the car in the tiny parking lot I noticed the smell of BBQ smoke. It was only enhanced as I entered the establishment. Aside from the delicious smell of BBQ, which has permeated every fiber of my clothing and still lingers, I was greeted by a huge version of their menu posted to the wall. I opted for the smaller hand held version though. It was easier to read. After looking at said menu for a few minutes I decided on the brisket dog. I also ordered a side of corn nuggets based on reccomendations from my dining acquaitance of the day. The hot dog was immense to the point where I gave up eating it with my hands and went with the fork and knife method. It was a heavy gauge dog with a fantastic red color and the nice snap of a natural casing. But it was difficult to actually see that beneath the truck load of fried onions, chopped brisket and nacho cheese. What a gut buster this behemoth is. Then there are the corn nuggets. Little bite sized fried pieces of corny goodness. It is best described as fried creamed corn. It is crunchy on the outside and creamy on the inside with the sweetness I have grown to love. Frying it just adds to the alure. After eating the dog and these corn nuggets along with drinking a cup of lemonade, I am stuffed."

To this day I still think that it was not even tea. It was a murky, brownish-green color, and tasted like dirty salt water.\n2. The waiter could not understand my appetizer order. I ordered vegetable tempura, but he kept on verifying that I was ordering the shrimp tempura combination. This went on for 5 minutes.\n3. We ordered miso soup and it never arrived at the table. When I told the waiter that we never received the soup, he said \"yes it is right here on the ticket.\" It took another 5 minutes for him to realize that it never arrived, and was not ingested. \n4. The food was sub-par and not fresh."

Zack S...um this place closes at 11 so you couldn't have possibly hit the bar...so yeah if your gonna post fake reviews at least check your facts..\nThis place has so much potential, yet the ridiculously bad service just overshadowed everything good they did.\nThis is probably the worst service I have ever received in my life. \nDo you guys remember in Pretty Woman when Julia Roberts goes into the first store on Rodeo and the snooty lady acts like she's too good for this place? Well that's what they did to us.\nWhere's the hostess? Oh she's chatting with her friend...*ignoring me*\nWe finally get seated and then we sit and wait...\nand wait...\nand wait...\nfinally I get up and ask one of the waiters at the cash register to send over someone...\nShe treats us like we're a nuisance to her, she's singing along to the song that's playing...(WTF?) I think they turned up the music louder as more people left because by the time it was near closing time it was blaring hip hop music...really weird considering it was a nice casual Italian restaurant.\nWe order almost 200 bucks worth of food, and then she's like \"is that it?\"\nexcuse me bitch...watch the attitude...\nWait, wait, watch as all the waiters get together to talk about us...seriously I can see you whispering about us....this is so unprofessional right now....\nWe seriously waited for like an hour and a half, it was ridiculous! The place was practically empty! The waiters were standing around and chatting with each other. I took pictures as evidence!\nThis place is supposed to be a nice place, for the prices they charge they should have a whole restaurant re-staffed because it was ridiculous! I have never felt more uncomfortable and treated so rudely in my life!\nI also wanted to order take out for later and apparently they don't have take out boxes? You're a restaurant? You don't have boxes? Seriously?\nThis is the worst experience in a restaurant I have ever had. I've gotten better service at Carls Jr in a shady neighborhood than this. \nI won't hesitate to tell everyone to avoid this restaurant when you're in Vegas because this was outrageous! No one treats me like that and gets away with it! I wish I had a You've been yelped card so I could give them a piece of my mind.\nI'm like those crazy housewives who have nothing better to do...I won't stop calling to speak to management until someone is fired. I'm serious, no one gets away with treating me like that without suffering repercussions. We don't play that, I'm sorry I'm not one of those quiet asian people who take your shit...I will not be silenced... You best believe. You're done..The end.\n*note I left for the manager*\n\"This is probably the most unprofessional and ridiculous restaurant I have ever had the misfortune to experience, not just from the our waitress, but the waitstaff and blatant ignorance from most of the employees I had to encounter.\"\n Anthony Nguyen"

The poke is always fresh and wonderfully tasty. A little more avocado would help though. For dinner, you can't go wrong with the burgers and get the side Caesar. Mmmmm. The fish dishes are also excellent but for my dollar, the burgers win out big time here. The ambience is awesome- great art on the walls and the staff is super friendly. Kyle rocks!! Add it together and this has become my favorite place to grab a bite or take a date."

I only gave it four stars because the food is nothing to be excited about but it's not bad. The atmospere is great and I enjoy the coffee. I would highly recommend the Mojo, a mixture of expresso and chai tea. I will agree with the other reviewers that the service is a little slow, so go to Orange table if you're not in a hurry and want a place to sit and relax. The servers do make you feel welcome and don't rush you out like other restaurants do during the weekend rush."

Typically go for lunch and happy hour which are divine, but very impressed with dinner selections as well. Enjoyed the once a year prix fixe featured during restaurant week (RW) with a 4 course offering of several options to choose from. The empanadas were very good, chile rellano comes with seafood but asked for chicken and they obliged, the cornbread casserole has bacon in it which should be listed on menu and I do not believe was. I do not eat pork and since my son is a vegetarian when I shared a taste with him the waiter informed him it had bacon in it. No worries they replaced my side with the cheddar mash potatoes (scrumptious). The only complaint is the feeling of being completely stuffed upon our departure. :-). Will continue to revisit all the Fuego locations to enjoy their Latin cuisine. However my favorite meals are the happy hour or lunch menu over dinner. The lunch menu is truly representative if Latin cuisine and the dinner more southwest style. Either way good eating."

The down lounge has a bar and outdoor seating area that feature a lake with a engulfing rainforest to surround the entire area.\nA large viewing screen offers entertainment throughout the night and the seasonal cocktails a really delicious.

    "text": "Had lunch here the other day for the first time and it was a very nice experience. The restaurant is very modern in design, but a little bit too closer quarters. The tables seem to be a bit too close together so you are siting very close to everyone else near you.. The waitress we had was very friendly and had our drinks refilled before they were empty even though they were fairly busy. As is par for the course in some places in Phoenix the parking is horrible with most of the good spots reserved for the store next door. It's a bit of a hike from the back lot to the restaurant . I'm not sure where you would park if the lot is full; I guess we lucked out. The fries were pretty tasty I don't think they are the best I have ever had, but they are quite good. I had the Green pasta as recommend in the other reviews and it is very good and should be tried even if you aren't a veggie person. We had the brownie for desert, I'm not really a fan of that it tasted a bit too undercooked and it was incredibly sweet. It tasted more like sugar than brownie/cake like. \nTry:\n - Green Pasta\n - Sweet Potato Fries"

My first trip I hadn't eaten all day and stopped on my way back at about 5pm and was served my first order within minutes and was done with the meal in probably 20 minutes.

I sat at the sushi bar, was promptly handed a little tray of ginger and wasabi and my order was taken as fast as I could decide and ready in about three minutes. All good and I especially like they don't overload the sushi with rice. (eel was particularly delicious!) \nHere's the problem... when the check came I looked at the bill and way below everything I actually ordered which was written neatly on the top was a $5 charge for the ginger and wasabi... hidden neatly under the pocket that held the bill.\nI can describe this in one word \"Cheesy\"\nThis is the kind of thing that will stop me from coming back.\nI"

    "text": "Had a fabulous time here with my husband celebrating my birthday last weekend. We both got \"The Farmer's Feast\" and it was truly amazing. I was not expecting that we would each get unique dishes so that let us sample even more of the food (though the hubby didn't really share too much). I highly recommend this option for anyone dining here. \nThe antipasti was a great selection of cured meats and local cheeses. Next, I had a wonderful salad that was a great combination of sharp peppery flavors mixed with sweet. Strawberries, arugula, radishes, yum! For pasta course I got gnocchi with a rich and tasty cream sauce and my husband got ravioli stuffed with yam. His dish was amazing, I had to fight for a couple bites. For the fish course I had poached halibut that was served with some kind of really flavorful sauce and a vegetable puree so that whole thing was extremely delicious. The hubby got a very lightly seared tuna fillet. I was very surprised that he enjoyed it so much since he is usually not a raw fish kind of guy. For our main course I got a pork tenderloin and the hubby got braised beef... just lucky we each got our favorite meats. Each came with other vegetables and starches on the plate so they would have been an ample meal in and of themselves. For dessert, I got a goat cheese cheesecake that was truly amazing. One of the best deserts I have ever eaten. Very rich but the pieces were small enough so that it was not heavy. The dessert did not have too much sweetness so it went well with the ice wine it was served with which tasted like pure honey. Just fantastic. The hubby got bread pudding which we didn't much care for and it came with a sorbet that I didn't try. I got the wine pairings with the meal and every wine just complimented the dish it was served with so beautifully that I was really glad I added that option. Also, it ended up that you got a half glass (at least) with each course so I think it is a good value (the wine pairing was an extra $45.) \nI do agree with a couple of the reviewers who mentioned salt. There were a couple of dishes that had just a tad too much. However, I think that was not due to a mistake of the chef, I believe it is just because they use cured meats in a lot of their dishes. Another reviewer mentioned bad service but we did not experience that at all. Our server was extremely warm and friendly. She was very knowledgeable on the food and could answer any questions we had for her. She also took the time for each course to explain each dish and in my case the wine and why they went together. Only one time did my wine not come out at the same time with the food course and in that case our server apologized immediately. I do agree with some of the reviewers that the service is very slow... however, I believe that this is intentional. They have created a very cozy and comfortable environment and they want you to linger and enjoy yourself. With the Farmer's Feast in particular it took us almost 3 hours start to finish but I enjoyed every minute of it. It was nice to have time in between courses to sit and talk and relax. The spacing also kept us from feeling too full by the end (it is six courses after all!) or from letting the flavors from one dish influence the next. I was able to enjoy each course separately and independently with its own unique wine. It was pure food heaven. This is not the type of place where you would stop in for a meal before a show or event; when you come here, this should be your only destination for the night and it is such a great experience that it will be enough! We truly had fantastic night here.\nOne warning I will say is for ladies, you need to be prepared for the rural atmosphere and the walk from the car to the restaurant would be challenging in heels (I had been warned so had wedges). In fact the dress code overall was a bit more casual than I was expecting. Kai at Wildhorse Pass resort is my absolute favorite \"special occasion\" restaurant and so we were making a lot of comparisons between the two. My husband made the comment that when we were at Kai we spoke in library whispers the whole time and felt a little awkward at times (you know the type of place where you feel like if you use the wrong fork you may end up getting kicked out) but at Quiessence we were chatting away the whole time and completely at ease. It is definitely a much more comfortable and relaxed environment then any other I have experienced at a restaurant of this caliber."

He made me this AWESOMELY DELICIOUS drink with the banana bread infusion that I highly recommend if you love banana flavors. It tasted like a banana chocolate covered strawberry. GET IT! It is no joke delicious. My bf got a drink made from the mango Chile (i think it was) that was also delicious. We are however, adventurous when trying things. The spice might not be for everyone. The setting was very intimate, with a touch of a Gothic feel. It makes for a great date night too.

Unlike so many other cocktail bars in Edinburgh that are tiny and really loud, I liked that it was quieter although I count vouch for weekend nights. \nUnfortunately, where they really fall down is in the service. Tonight ten happy Yelpers came in to a very quiet Juniper and it took over half an hour to take our drink order, then over another hour to be served the first cocktails. For those of us indulging in the taster menu (see more below for a word of warning), it took us over two and a half hours to receive the four cocktails. This made for a long evening of waiting, and some frustrated Yelpers.\nI really enjoyed sharing a taster menu of cocktails as it was fun to get to try eight different cocktails and see what we liked best whilst navigating the extensive cocktail menu by taste. The server kindly let us share two taster menus - eight cocktails total - amongst four people but be careful since the menu does state that the £25 cost is per person. If sharing the taster menu with over two people, don't tell them you are sharing it! I think we only got away with it since we were bringing them so much business. The server made it clear that she was being extra specially nice to us even though we were receiving the eight cocktails amongst four instead of the four cocktails per person that is outlined in the £25 price. Call me a lightweight, but I didn't want four cocktails on a Tuesday night so I was really happy to share!"

Didn't think so. \nStopped by this Grimaldi's right around lunch time after my friends and I had tuckered ourselves out shopping for Christmas goodies around Boca Park. We were very hungry with visions of pizzas dancing in our heads as wen entered the rustic-looking establishment. It is not huge, nor is it small. The wooden tables and wooden decor all around make a nice, cozy feeling. I caught a glimpse of the lighting above, which are wine bottle hung from the ceiling - loved it!\nAs for the menu, it's straight up simple here so don't come looking for anything other than pizza, salad, or a calzone. There were no appetizers on the menu, to which I was slightly disappointed. This may be different at dinner, but I can't be sure.\nEverything here is pretty much build your own pizza, which I think is pretty cool. We started with the white garlic pizza (large), added grilled chicken, fresh Roma tomatoes, fresh basil, and for a nice spicy kick - jalapenos. Often times I think fresh tomatoes on pizzas make them soggy and gross, but luckily this one did not.\nThe pizza came out relatively fast; it is a nice, crispy, thin pizza, with a bubbly, brown, crunchy crust. I am not a pizza-connoisseur so I am not sure what \"style\" this may be, but I enjoyed it. I think we got just the right amount of toppings, anymore and the poor pizza would not have withheld them.\nMy suggestions: come if you want PIZZA, straight up, nothing else. Build your own and experiment with toppings. BUT - do not go crazy, I'd say, 3 *maybe* 4 toppings at the most and make sure you're putting stuff on there that makes sense.\nOverall I was pleased, between the three of us we got an amazing pizza, plenty of toppings, and splitting the bill we each owed UNDER $10. Yes. That's a damn good deal. Of course, remember, there were three of us splitting a large, so prices may vary! I will definitely come back here to try some more styles and toppings."

That just didn't seem right. But sitting in front of the computer now, with a belly full of hot dog, I've never been happier. \nAnd if a doctor instructs you to eat more hot dogs, there are few places in town serving a better frank than Chicago Tasty Dogs. I've read the negative reviews on here, but my experience has been completely different. This place serves up the best Chicago dog in town. The tomatoes and onions were fresh, the relish was neon green, the pickle wedge sliced right, and two pickled sport peppers to top it all off. And the Vienna Beef hot dog was perfect.\nThe chili cheese dog was pretty good--delicious cheese sauce, but the chili was just decent. I'm not the biggest fan of the fries here, but I will say they are the closest thing to Chicago shoestring fries -- a little gritty, but crisp with a slight paper bag feel to them.\nFor those refugees from Chicagoland living in the desert, this place is home away from home. The walls are covered in Chicago memorabilia. And if you're missing the Windy City, this place will feel like home.\n5 stars for the Chicago dog, their hot dogs in general, the cheese sauce, and great customer service. Minus one star for high(er) fast food prices ($9-10 for 2 dogs, small fries and small drink) and mediocre fries."

We were given a lot of attention throughout the meal and that was nice.\nThe lobster bisque was great- flavorful and served in a large bowl.\nThe filet mignon was served with broccoli and mashed potatoes. It was nothing exciting or special. Most everyone in the group was not happy with the way their meat was cooked.\n My desert of creme brûlée was the highlight. \nI enjoyed my cocktail but at $10, I only ordered one.\nI am glad our meal was for a good cause, but I don't think I will be returning to Twin Creeks."

It's the closest fast food joint to my house, which is why I guess I've gone there as much as I have (3 or 4 times) versus going somewhere else like In N Out. The place always seems clean. The service is fine. The food is always piping hot. I do notice longer waits here than in other fast food chains but I think that's because they make every single thing fresh when you order (instead of having burgers stacked up ready to be handed out)."

Friendly service and cool workers. \nSo why only 3 stars? It is JUST A-OK. It should have a sign that says\" Congratulations you found the hipster Sbarros\" That's really all it is, its decent pizza for a decent price (for the strip) and a cool concept. I am rating this on the food not the concept. A Sbarro that you can choose your own toppings is all you get. If you are hammered coming from Marquee then you will probably love this place. \nIf you are like me and have had good pizza before and are sober when trying it or only a few cocktails in then OK is what you get. It's not bad and it's not all that good. It is the cheapest place to eat in the cosmo so that probably why people rate it so high. \nIt is worth checking out or bringing people that have never seen it before but for repeat business it's just not my style."

Oh well. They were out of gluten free (which is usually just my preference) so we got the sprouted grain. Then we had to order a mushroom after we heard about the man who grows them in his basement, followed by a vegan and a margherita. \nNeedless to say, the way the bare bones vegan pizza was made said enough. If an almost nothing pizza could be that good, they clearly have the basics down, and everything else should be awesome - and it was. \nThe only thing not awesome? The $50 for three 12\" pizzas. I understand why, but at the same - seriously??? The honey samples she threw in kind of made up for it I guess. But next time I'll ask for a few more toppings, because when I added olives to my margherita, I ended up with the equivalent of about half of an olive minced and sprinkled on. kinda lame. I did have a nice surprise with the other topping I added, though - the arugula is in sprout form!\nI will return, because it's darn good pizza, and if given the choice I'd definitely pay more so I could eat that delicious crust."

    "text": "I absolutely LOVE this place, but I have heard that people either love it or hate it, so your mileage may vary.\nFirst off, everything is a la carte. There are no \"combo platters\" or anything like that. You order what you want. (don't forget the Yelp check-in special for free chips and salsa!)\nDon't expect \"sit-down\" Mexican restaurant with waitstaff, plates, and silverware. If you think of it more like a stationary food truck, you may have a better idea of what this place is all about. I have tried everything on the menu and have not been disappointed. Unlike some other reviewers, I have not experienced the \"dry meat\" syndrome, although sometimes we have seen pretty light cheese on the quesadillas. The \"Papa Loca\" is something I have not seen on the menu anywhere else, and it is both tasty and filling, but I really prefer the tacos and gorditas. My wife and kids really like the quesadillas. Don't forget to grab some sauces, pico, and salsa from the salsa bar to dress up your tacos -- they are traditional and very simply prepared. Therein lies the beauty. \nThe place is small and can get VERY crowded, but service generally remains pretty fast. I have not been there on \"taco Tuesday\" when they drop the price on their tacos, but I can imagine the place becomes a veritable zoo. \nI found the beans to be a little bland, but anyone who has made real refried beans at home knows that many recipes don't call for a lot of seasoning in the beans -- that way, you can add that after the fact with toppings and salsas.\nThe horchata is worth getting: it always tastes fresh."

    "text": "This is my favorite of Pittsburgh's many craft beer breweries and there are several reasons why this establishment is close to my heart. As a neighborhood brewery, they are as good as it gets. With bi-annual group bike rides for charity, knowledgeable and friendly staff, and an environment that invites and promotes the discovery and discussion of beer, East End Brewing is a fantastic destination for just about anyone who enjoys quality brews.\nMost of the beer is available on tap and distributed on a per customer basis through refillable growlers. I like that this promotes a conscious reuse of materials and reduces the net resource impact of the brewery's activities. Several specialty brews are also available in 750ml bottles. Samples of all the beer are available upon request free-of-charge at the brewery and are highly advisable given the following:\nAll of their beer is live, qualifying as \"real ale,\" and provides pro-biotic benefits alongside great flavor. As a fermentation enthusiast, I appreciate that my local brewer risks an occasional lapse in quality control for a shot at greatness. This means that their beer will be slightly different every time I go due to the metabolic processes ongoing within. I feel this is a huge advantage over other area breweries that are more interested in producing a predictable and easily distributed beer. After all, why drink a local beer brewed to withstand shipment across the country when there are better beers shipped in to Pittsburgh from other places available at a comparable price? East End's products are uniquely fresh, competitively priced, and variable. This variability is exactly why you should try the beers on-tap before purchasing a growler as even the year-round brews are bound to differ batch to batch and evolve with age. As for the bottled beer, it is \"conditioned\" in the bottle (meaning naturally carbonated by ongoing fermentation) and thus a given bottle will taste different than one consumed on a different day. The gamble of live beer allows for a shot at the legendary, something many other local breweries don't even try out of fear of the occasional bad beer. East End gives it a go and succeeds 9 times out of 10.\nNow that I have cleared up exactly why I think East End is the best brewery in Pittsburgh, here are my opinions about a few of the beers: The Monkey Boy (hefeweizen) is perhaps one of the greatest of this style brewed in America. It is impossible to get one this good, this fresh, unless you are in Belgium. A fresh bottle of imported Franziskaner comes close. Fat Gary (nut brown ale) is alright fresh but truly excels if you leave your growler un-opened in the fridge for several days. Somehow this always tastes thin from the tap but matures quickly in the growler. Big Hop (IPA) is a standard, a great beer to have fresh, but is eclipsed by competitors in a crowded and popular American style. Black Strap Stout is quaff-able quality anytime of year and indicates that you should never pass on the brewery's darker seasonal beers in the colder months. There is a rotating selection of seasonal brews that you should ALWAYS try when you stop in for a refill.\nThe staff has been of great help in my own brewing endeavors by providing sound advice and encouragement. It is well worth your time to visit East End and try a few of their beers whether you are an accomplished beer aficionado or stepping outside of the mainstream for the first time. The hours are weird but the beer is literally one-of-a-kind."

Here's my thoughts!\n\"Viking-style Brunch\" \nFruit box - a variety of seasonal fruits served on bed of ice. Great to nibble on while waiting on my other guests to arrive. Enjoyed very fresh squeezed orange juice. \nLiege Waffles - absolutely amazing. Lightly crisped waffles served with this great spread selection. Chocolate ginger and white chocolate mousse. We mixed them together. Incredible. \nSous Vide Eggs - sweet potato hash compliments the duck pastrami and egg that's cooked to a nice creamy perfection. All of this is drizzled with a yuzu hollandaise.. Making a very eclectic spin on the traditional brunch eggs Benedict. \nThere is a sushi cart offered with a widespread variety of rolls, sashimi and nigiris. We nibbled lightly on this .. Wanting to fill up on the brunchy goodness. \nYou're then offered a salad for the table... And we each got to select an entree. I chose the spicy filet... Always a favorite. My guests chose the jiodori chicken and the salmon teriyaki. We also devoured their wild mushroom kamamashi pot. Great warm ending to the meal. Especially for a rainy brunch Sunday. \nI definitely recommend pairing your brunch with bubbles. We paired our waffles and eggs with the Moët Rose, but they offer a great list of bubbles and cocktails to start your Sunday off right. \nOverall, Baku impresses again. For $36 a guest...to eat such an impressive array... Definitely a go-to brunch spot for something delicious that's a fresh change of pace."

They stared at me confused and pointed to the 3 drinks. \nOur server was most likely new. We were at a round table, yet he leaned over the entire front of me and my full plate to fill my husband's tea, placing his armpit neatly over my face. He didn't bring bread or silver wear until we asked. But he was nice, which IS important. \nIt's been about a year since I've been to a Carrabas. Not only have the names of some entrees changed, but so have the portion sizes. Down with size, up with price. Nice. My husband always enjoys paying $16 for a handful of pasta and pasty sauce. \nI got the Caesar salad. Limp, room temperature, gross. Not typical of what I'm use to from this chain . Also, the spices they put on the plate with olive oil for the bread was super salty. \nMy youngest was offered broccoli but they came back to say they were out. It happens. The kids pizza was bordering burnt - 0.5/4 slices were eaten. \nWe ALWAYS get calamari. This time it was fried too long. I think we got the bottom of the bag because the pieces were tiny and extremely greasy. Shiny greasy. Grease. \nYou know that awesome lemon butter and pepper sauce they serve with the calamari? It was unrecognizable. Like a small bowl of yellowish brownish oil. Kinda looked like Papa John's new garlic crud (not the nice creamy one from the 90's), but still tasted ok.

Reminiscent of urban outfitters or paper skyscraper. Staff was friendly and attentive. Hours are a little tight, check before going--I first tried on a Sunday and they're closed then."

    "text": "Despite repeatedly telling the BF that it really doesn't matter where we stay, he insisted on staying at the Palazzo. What's a girl to do, right? When the man has his heart set on something, there's no changing his mind.\nWe had the Luxury Suite with View, up on 45th floor. Boy I love those express elevators. Oh yeah .. the view from the room isn't so bad either. :-P We could see down to the pools for both Palazzo and Venetian, as well as Tao beach; and also part of the strip. :-) \nThe room was very spacious even with a King size bed and a full-size living room complete with an ottoman. Although I thoroughly enjoyed it while I was in the shower and while I was getting ready in the evening, I thought the 3 TVs (1 in the living room, 1 in the bedroom, and 1 in the bathroom) was a little excessive -- of course the BF didn't think so and only wished there was 1 in the restroom as well.\nThis might be a girl thing, but I thought the lit-magnifying mirror with different light settings was an awesome invention! It has daytime setting which is the brightest, nighttime which is the dimmest and \"office\" which would then turn on the florescent light. It's genius!\nThe bed, believe it or not, I actually did a running start from the hallway and jumped into the bed like a high-jump Olympic champion. It was that high and that plush. It's one of those beds where you just sink in, and yet it's firm at the same time. The sheet's a little on the stiff side so when you move it makes a lot of noise, but it's still very comfortable.\nThe service, now I know how kings and queens feel. \nAs soon as we arrived in the valet line, someone greeted us and asked if we'd need help with our suitcases -- which was brought up to our room within 5-10 minutes we got there. The line to check-in moved quickly. Staff was very friendly and very helpful with every questions and requests. We all know the air there is dry, but did you know that you can request for a humidifier? It made sense that they do, but who knew!\nI'm not a gambler, so I was glad to see that I didn't have to go through 10 miles of casino area to get to our room.\nAnd, is it weird to get excited over illy's cafe located in between Palazzo and Venetian connection? :-)\nThis was an awesome trip. Thank you BF. :-)\nIt was a very relaxing trip to Vegas. We had plenty of rest at night *and* we'd take a nap during the day. It was good for me, although the BF said it's a little too tame for him. \nOh well, he can have his guy's weekend out here when I'm not around. :-)\n-----------\nP.S I'm confused and curious as to what happened with the yelpers who had such bad experience at this hotel."

What i love about this place obviously is the 24 hours of service, very \"Vegas\" ambiance (neon everywhere with mirror walls) and very good food and service. Service again is awesome, they even have cocktail waitresses that serve alcohol with your dinner. \nI would recommend hands down the BBQ pork ribs dinner , the meat is so tender it falls off the bones and the rack is so big it hangs off the plate. Get it with a side of onion rings, chicken chowder soup and a coke and you are set! Other notable favorites include the Chicken Fried Steak, Buffalo Chicken Wrap and Lasagna.\nThe lounge inside the restaurant is also pretty fun especially if you are like me and do not really prefer the loud expensive ass clubs on the strip."

And why did it take me so long to have their brunch?!?\nMy friend and I stopped in for a late brunch Sunday afternoon, we had a small wait for a table but I got VIP parking right on front of the restaurant so we just chatted and waited in the car until they called us in. \nNot long after we were seated our waiter arrived, very pleasant smile and attitude it was like we were old friends. He took our drink orders and offered tons of suggestions. Based on previous reviews, I already knew what I wanted to try...the Pasta, Sausage, and Eggs which is three eggs with chicken sausage, penne pasta, spinach, and cheese...(thanks JJ! ) I decided to skip the mushrooms this visit but they normally come with this dish as well. As I my side I decided to change the grits for the hash browns. My friend ordered the salmon scramble with grits and a side of bacon.\nEven though, it was packed it took no time me my food was awesome!!!! \nMy food was delicious!!! The mix of pasta, chicken sausage and eggs was so unique I just loved it! Just an overall hearty and tasty dish. The hash browns were very tasty but my friend let me try her grits and I could have kicked myself for not ordering them!!! They really were creamy and dreamy!!! Sooo much better than I expected. I tried to keep my spoon out of her dish but I couldn't...next time TRUST that I will be getting the grits!!!\nFabulous meal, great service and just overall excellent experience!

Had we paid the full menu price for want we got, it would have been ABV - appallingly bad value.\nThe major flaw in the meal was that the appetizer three cheese/ flatbread plate Was served with ice cold cheese. Any brain dead idiot knows that chilling cheese virtually eliminates its flavor; the flavor blooms at room temperature, the temperature at which cheese is made. We couldn't believe it. Our two salads (house and Greek) were adequate but very small. The entrees were quite good - pasta bolognese and pappardelle with duck confit - although the duck leg was a bit overlooked. The wines, a chardonnay and Pinot noir, included in the deal and on the regular menu at $8 each, are excellent."

Food was good, service was fine, but there was only one other customer besides us. Today we went there at 7:30 on Saturday, the place was almost empty when we got there but quickly filled up. First off, they were out of their homemade turkey sausage, that I wanted to try. I changed my order to Huevos Rancheros, and was really disappointed. The eggs were fine, but the beans were greasy, I could see a layer of lard floating on top of them. At $8.99 I thought it was really over priced. My husband had the pancake combo with bacon, he thought the bacon was over cooked, and the pancakes were almost raw, they were gummy and severly undercooked. As for service, our coffee was never refilled, once our food was dropped off we were completely ignored until the check was left. Customers around us were complaining, the woman behind us had to order her tea 3 times before it arrived, the man behind us complained that his order was wrong, many customers seemed unhappy with the wait and the service. I was really disappointed, I realize that they have only been open a couple of weeks, so we might return in a few months, if they survive that long. It's really too bad, I like small, locally owned restaurants, but the experience today was so bad that I'm not in any hurry to return. They got 2 stars, because our first visit was fine."

Jimmy, the congenial owner, is typically shaking hands and verifying his patrons enjoyment.\nValet parking and a limited number of private lot spots are available.There also seems to be a solid rotation of cute hostesses to greet you upon entry.\nThe lunch menu is minimalist but pleasing, every item I have ordered has been satisfactory. It is a great place to watch afternoon golf or other sports at the bar. The patio and bocce ball court are lively and fun for happy hour in nice weather.\nThe clientele is an equal ratio of male and female 25-60 year old professionals for lunch, I have been told that it gets a bit sexier when the sun goes down."

    "text": "Name has been changed to Southern Nevada Medical & Rehab Center, it's still a facility that is skilled nursing with an emphasis on rehab services for it's residents- that means two of three rehab specialties (physical, occupational, speech) twice a day. This is different from long term skilled nursing facilities where rehab is twice a week. The staff is pretty on top of the situation with a diverse group of patients with multiple medical challenges. I found being an advocate for my mom was important, as she was in pain, on a tad too much medication and not always able to express herself properly to the right person to get whatever was needed taken care of for her needs. The nursing staff are pretty much wonderful, you have to understand, the large Filipino staff, tend to call older women, Mama, as a term of endearment/respect. If you want them to address the patient by first or last name, just ask that of the nursing manager for the unit (there are two), so, each time there is a staff change (7am & 7pm) you don't have to have it repeated. There was an issue with getting appropriate transport and x-ray sent with mom to a medical appt. It finally happened and I called the social worker to request an incident report be filed to see what went wrong (w/chair instead of a gurney, mobile x-rays taken, but not sent). The Unit Nursing Manager called and then advised the next day of their errors and how the system would be corrected and staff in-serviced to prevent it happening to others. I was pleased with the prompt action.\nThe food is another story. Despite working consistently with the Nutritionist, the menu selected or doctor's prescribed diet was not arriving consistently. When this was brought to his attention, he conferred with Director of Food Services and food choices improved. The food is okay. For yourself- I highly recommend Magura in the adjacent mini-mall, either pizza/sandwich take out or the sit down restaurant for dinner. The restaurant has some wonderful Bulgarian food items. Either place is tasty with ample portions and very reasonably priced. Down Maryland Pkway is Jason's Deli on the left or turn right on Twain for Bagelmania in the shopping center on the left before Spencer. The rehab staff is younger and tends to push older residents, without regards to age limited capabilities, so, it's important to ask to attend a p.t. or o.t. session with your loved one to be a cheering section. The social work folks, including the case manager are great! My mom has been there going on six weeks. I've never met the staff doctor- Dr. 'G' as he's called; but, found the Physician's Assistant, John to be amenable to talking with me about medications and changes; and the medication nurses are also very helpful, as is the wound care nurse. It's a challenge for someone alone to be in this situation, so, if you can at all plan twice a day visits, it would be helpful. My mom has had five or six roommates (all are double bed rooms), so, the average length of stay is shorter for most."

Little Caesar's on the right...pizza, pizza! Grimaldi's down the street...pizza, pizza, pizza! CPK across the street along with Sammy's next to it...pizzzzaaaaa. Yes, we in America are infatuated with anything on baked dough. Other countries only dream about having so much bread around! \nWhen Custom Built Pizza came to be, I thought of it as a great concept. It's like Subway, for pizza! Build it how I want it! My way! Execution, ah, good but not great for me.\nFor us, Custom Built Pizza is a bit out of our way since we live darn near across town from where this place is in the SW. We made the trek because I purchased a few Groupons back then for what basically was a buy one get one free deal. Value for sure. \nPlace is nice enough, room for small families, and can handle a nice lunch rush crowd. We ended up going for dinner. Each pizza averages about $9 each for an 8-inch personal pizza. And each pizza can be loaded with any of the toppings that are available on the fixings line. Wish I knew about their lunch special for $7, might have got more bang-for-the-buck on our Groupons. Oh well.\nCustom Built Pizza starts just like a Subway or Chipotle type factory line restaurant. So don't go in and just sit down waiting for a menu! It's not like a regular pizza joint. You choose your dough - usually regular, whole wheat, or gluten-free. You choose your sauce - marinara, alfredo, pesto, BBQ, or their spicy diavolo. They you choose your toppings - there's lots available; pepperoni, chicken, sausage, ham, lots of veggie, and different cheeses. Last I remember the toppings were very fresh, veggies looked fresh sliced and cut. After that, it's off to the oven for a quick cook! Seriously, your pizza will be done usually in under 10 minutes since they are of the thin crust style. Which I happen to like very much.\nOur family of four was on the table eating in less than 20 minutes. The kids liked their pizzas, but who knows what they really tasted like because they threw almost half the list of ingredients on their pies! Kids. I thinks the entire process of building something of their own creation appealed to the Frankenstein in them.\nI on the other hand wasn't totally convinced. My pizza was pretty good, and the toppings were excellent. What I wasn't fond of was the crust. As we all know, a great pizza is built on a foundation of crust. Bad crust = Bad pizza. I won't go so far as saying the crust was bad, it just wasn't what I was expecting. It was a bit bland. I'm thinking a bit of salt would have helped? The crust on my pizza just didn't have much taste. And I wished it was a bit more done too, I like seeing the little black parts on the bottom of my crust. Totally adds to the taste and texture. Good pizza, but for what you pay it should be a tad more refined I think. Nothing that can't be adjusted.\nAnother reason why I'm in the 3-star zone on Custom Built Pizza? No Coca-Cola! Pepsi! Really, Coca-Cola just sounds better saying it in Italian! But I understand with the soda wars now, getting a restaurant to choose a side comes down to what is a better deal. \nFriendly folks working, and couldn't be more accommodating. I even asked for arugula to be placed on my pizza AFTER baking and was met with no resistance. I'm sure this place is very popular for the lunch crowd, and for the gym-goers at the LVAC right across the way for a post-workout meal. \nI would go back if I was in the area, but not entirely sure if I would drive to Custom Built Pizza on a craving whim. There's just so many other pizza joints near me!"

Very tasty and stands well without the sauce. I found the Smokey sauce the best flavor of the three offered but it also tastes a bit too salty. I found I enjoyed lunch without the sauce and that is exactly how it is served - saucless. My two sides were the Sweet Potatoe Fries and Potato Salad. Both were 2 thumbs up but you get more fries than potato salad. If quantity counts, then weigh that in. Lunch was a bit crowded and seating was tough to come by. Every server there seemed concerned that we would enjoy our visit.\nBottom line: I'll be back and it is worth seeking out. Really want to try their Pork next!\nPS - Gotta pay attention to find it. Look for the coffee shop facing Deer Valley Road, with the Green sign that mimics Starbucks.\nPoF is located adjacent and behind that."

I will say though that the one enterance and exit is a pain, since if you get seated on the opposite end of the room, you have to walk all around to get out. And some of the staff are not very nice- there's one old asian lady I have seen a few times who has always had a very sour mood."

This place is right down the street from my house and was the only pizza place that close for a few years. Until Cici's pizza opened up across the street. I immediately thought \"Uh Oh there goes Mama Depalma's\" But they have survived and held their own... Cici's is sooo CHEAP but there is no pizza comparison here... Cici's is yucky , the kids love it but kids will love any pizza right? Bottom Line is I'd rather spend my hard earned money on Mama Depalma's even though I would spend less at Cici's. I had one bad service experience there which I have gotten over....Have you ever had pizza with a splash of balsamic vinegar? I'm pretty sure many of you said No, Gross...well don't knock it until you try it. They did it for me here and it was sooo yummy!!!!"

I haven't had a bad sandwhich from this place, or any other Capriotti's in town. THe cheesesteaks are above par as well. The only issues I have with this chain are the lack of drink varieties and the price. I'm not saying it's not worth the price because inch for inch you're paying for quality meats and condiments.

    "text": "The Old Spaghetti Factory\" was probably one of the first restaurants my wife and I ate at when we started dating. Money was tight back then and TOSF soon became one of our favorite eats. I hate to compare this place to a fast food restaurant, but this place is like the \"McDonald's\" of Italian food. Now let me explain that. When you go to McDonald's, it doesn't matter where in the country, or in the world, you are, when you order a cheeseburger, you know what you are going to get. It's consistent and it's inexpensive. The same can be said for TOSF. It's decent quality Italian food, at very fair prices. \nI've sampled many things on the menu over the years, but lately I always get the same thing when we go out for dinner; Spaghetti and Meatballs. I know most people wouldn't think to order something that you can make at home out, but I like a good meat sauce and my wife would rather have marinara. So, for me, it's a treat. She adores the spaghetti with mizithra cheese and brown butter, although, last night she ordered the meatloaf and said she found a new favorite dish. I'll have to try it next time. I'm usually the one that goes for the \"soul food\". Dinner is usually served with a salad, and their creamy pesto dressing (similar to a ranch) is really amazing. Remember to save a little room for desert, because you always get your choice of a scoop of ice cream, spumoni, or sherbet afterwards.\nTOSF is definitely kid friendly. It is a true family restaurant. The trolley car in the middle of the restaurant is always a draw with the little ones. There can be a wait sometimes. Call ahead and put your name on the list, since they don't take reservations. The 1980's era arcade games are great to pass the time and bring back many memories of wasted quarters of my youth. TOSF is one of those places that will always leave you full of good food and great memories...even if it is a chain."

There were two other groups in the lobby area with about 5-6 people each. The hostess told us it would be 40 minutes. She said they had plenty of tables open, but hardly any servers. We decided to leave and go elsewhere. I'll update after we actually make it past the lame teenage hostess in less than 40 minutes. Hopefully they'll get some waitstaff by then...\nUpdate:\nI did manage to get seated and eat a meal here. The deep fried mushrooms were great and very tasty. The service was mediocre at best. The actual waiter that was waiting our table didn't actually come to our table until the end of our meal. We had the manager and another person waiting our table. The steak I had was overcooked and not that great. Our waiter did offer to bring our another, but I wasn't going to go through all of that at this point. He did manage to give us some free appetizer coupons and I think he got a little bit taken off of the bill. Pretty good for a guy who was never at our table. It wasn't his fault, but he did his best to make it up. Kudos to him - we gave him a decent tip just for that. Next time I think I'll stick to a BBQ sandwich. I'll up it from 2 to 3 stars.\nSecond Update:\nWe gave it another shot with our free appetizer coupons and had a much better experience. They had a great seasonal beer and my pulled pork sandwich was delicious. I think I had a few crazy experiences here, but if I sit inside at a non-crazy time, it should be okay. It's not outta-this-world, but some decent BBQ in an area with limited options."

Once you do get someone, they are short and rushed and do not know the details of the technology. They have became nothing more than a sales person.

Sauce is notably tangy, reminding me of many places in the Chicago area with very tangy sweet sauce. Cheese though... it was somewhat gummy and stuck together too much (take one bite, and you risk losing half the cheese off the entire slice in one adhesive layer). Perhaps it was overcooked a little and it crisps up too much. Very moist with grease on top.\nI'll give them another shot or two and see how different toppings go."

That was okay because my wife wanted to shake her fine booty on the dance floor. If I came here with a group, I would opt for a table which i hear can be pricey.\nSpeaking of which, the dance floor gets crowded fast so either practice your vertical dance moves or avoid it altogether. My wife had a minor altercation with a female patron trying to get her \"freak\" on. I guess she got too close to her dance \"expressions\".

I'm sure they are waiting for the weather to get warmer but they have heat lamps out there so they can use it now... hint hint =) \nThe interior is sleek and urban with orange and brown accents that match their logo/theme.

Dining area is much more family feel while bar is casual cool wine lounge with yummy food. OF course the centerpiece are the two pizza ovens in the kitchen area. And if you are wondering, that's the kitchen... that's it, all open. Isn't that crazy?\nAnd you can if you want, stand up at the glass partition to watch them make your pizza. I watched them for a bit and that's when Chef Carlos said hi and told me about the open kitchen. \nI just got off work and was hungry so I went straight for the good stuff.. the pizza. There are two kinds of pizza: Neapolitan or Roman. I was like, what is Roman style. Apparently, it's like a cracker crust. I will try next time. I ordered the Picante (cuz I like it spicy), and added garlic and an over-easy egg. I love pizza places that add egg to the top of the pizza! Well needless to say, the pizza was amazing and spicy. The Sopressata, red peppers, garlic, San Marzano tomato and egg all worked together. The crust is thick enough to hold the toppings and probably a couple more. I usually dip my remaining crust in olive oil and I ended up pouring the olive oil all over the pizza - some good olive oil. \nNext time I will need to try the app, esp the Carpaccio, Gnocchi, Scampi the Mozzarella Bar, and of course more pizza. Ciao!"

We saw Crust next door and decided to give it a try. \nFinally, we had the dining experience we have been looking for. From the service to the flawless food, we had an amazing time. This is the best Italian we have found in Scottsdale. \nThe strip mall does not serve Crust at all, it is truly the diamond in the rough. Everything is fresh, creative and mouth watering. \nWe had the spinach and artichoke dip for our appetizer. Best EVER! \nI had the special, linguine with clam sauce and Jason had the meatball parm calzone. Have you ever seen the movie Ratatouille? Well we felt like the food critic at the end enjoying the speechless, delicious meal. \nWe ended our meal with the special, cookies and cream cheese cake. Ladies, this is not one of those desserts where you can eat a couple bites and leave the rest to your man ... it is so delicious we were fighting each other for the last bite. \nTheir drink selection is marvelous. Jason had the key lime pie martini. It was like none other. It was key lime to the core and they even included the pie crust crunch. \nThe service was watertight. I have never seen such a hard working staff. They helped each other out, glasses were always full and extremely willing to provide anything needed at every table. \nI can't wait to go back!!!!"

Luckily my curiosity got the better of me and I finally took a chance... and my husband and I have been regulars there ever since. \nThis is not your boring chain establishment. Gino's is a fun and friendly neighborhood eatery and bar. They have poker most nights and dart tournaments, trivia contests, ladies nights with champagne and massages on other nights. Even during their 'quiet times' the staff is fun and friendly and always makes our visit a pleasure.... and then there's the food. I've been going there for a few months now and have made it a point to try different things. I've only been disappointed in two items and one of those was just a personal preference. (The french bread pizza didn't have enough sauce and wasn't cooked enough even after being sent back. The meat loaf is not what I am used to with its brown gravy. I'm a ketchup meat loaf kinda gal so it wasn't what I expected... but it wasn't too bad.) The portions are always more than enough and the prices are always much less than you'd expect.\nThere are two reasons that I didn't give them a 5 star rating... they rarely have all of the desserts listed on the menu (and there aren't that many) and they have a NO FIREARMS sign out front. \nAll in all, Gino's is doing one heck of a great job!"

Where do I even begin with the crappiest hotel experience?\nWe stayed here over Columbus Day weekend for a friend's 30th Bday celebration. We got a king suite with an adjoining two queen room in the Paradise Tower. \nStrike 1: They advertised a pullout couch and there was NO pullout couch. We called for a rollaway which they wanted to charge $20 a night. Excuse me? False advertising and I have to pay for it?! Called three times until finally got the rollaway in the room delivered. \nStrike 2: Asked for Nonsmoking room but the room reeked of smoke which did numbers on my allergies. I know I'm in Vegas, but I don't have to breath that crap while I sleep.\nStrike 3: the shower did not drain and water pooled up to my ankles. Called maintenance to repair and yet again they didn't show. Left for Pool/Brunch 4 hrs later returned with it still clogged. Called second time and finally they fixed it after waiting around 30 min before we could get ready for dinner. \nStrike 4: There is no room in the fridge for your own refreshments and a fridge is again $20 a day. Seriously for a suite what good is an in room bar without a fridge? For the price of the room it should be available. Guess they don't want you not buying THEIR drinks.\nStrike 5: As a hotel guest we should get free admission to the day pool parties at least on a guest list. Nope still have to pay- seriously? Marquee Day Club offers this to their hotel guests why can't Hard Rock?\nStrike 6: the TV cable was so horrible and kept cutting out couldn't play any music stations from that and there was no Auxillary input to plug in our own music thru the TV speakers. \nWhen we complained to the reception they only comped us one resort fee wow a whopping $22.50. \nI have stayed multiple times at the Hard Rock San Diego which is newer and has better rooms. They have the aux cable, working showers and correctly advertised rooms. \nNever ever staying at this Hard Rock hotel!!"

I have baby fine hair and have not found too many stylists in the Phoenix area that actually know how to cut it correctly. I'm usually left with way too many layers making it look thin & scraggly. Jenn cut only a small amount off to clean it up and make the ends look fresh again. She slightly layered it, nothing extreme but it really improved the style so it does not look like an awkward mid-length stage of growing out. My hair appears to have much more volume just by the way she cut it and it even looks good when I air dry it. She listened to my hair concerns and goals and provided valuable styling tips and suggestions on how to keep the ends healthy while it grows out. She took her time & even though it was just a trim, she spent an entire hour with me."

You can tell this place is beloved by locals; several elderly couples, families with children, and single people with dogs on leash came by for cones, sundaes, and floats on the beautiful sunny day.

And no offense to anyone, but I feel like there were too many of the same types of employees (gay Male Hipsters) choosing what clothes were to be sold on the shelves! Not one of the shirts were tight fitted. They were all baggy, frayed, and cheap cut off looking! And Im thinking, wow why aren't there more girls working here? Straight women such as myself do not always like the styles that all these Gay hipster boys are picking out.. Nothing was sexy.. I couldn't even find a shirt that was flattering in the breast area, usually i like shirts that at least hug around my boobs, and all i kept thinking was \"If these dudes only knew what it was like to have boobs and find clothes for them, maybe then they would understand... And another thing I'd like to point out was, i looked at every tank top in the small section, and all the straps were too long, and would only fit me if I were a Granny with saggy tits down to by navel. Im sorry boys, gay or straight, unless you have tits, YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND what it takes for us girls to find a cute top that doesn't make us look like we just crawled out of a garbage pale!! This store used to be so diverse and cute, and its really gone to shit... I might give it another chance in the future, and if I only see one female working there again...

J's partridge was tasty but a bit tough, but the venison was amazing. \nLike Catriona, I find the fact the menu doesn't change a bit disconcerting - they must get bored with doing the same stuff, surely? Shouldn't it depend what's good on the day/ week? But .. they do it well, plenty of practice, I suppose! \nI would go back if I had visitors to Edinburgh who would appreciate good Scottish ingredients - you can get haggis in a fairly safe and non-scary little filo parcel, for example! But not if anyone in the group was vegetarian, as there's nothing at all listed for them to eat. And if it's just the two of us - probably not. There's too many other places in Edinburgh to try. \n*I won't blame them for the lack of phone coverage/ wifi, but it was frustrating for a geek like me. And it's odd that everything's downstairs, leaving an empty waiting-room area on street level. Going up there to go to the loo was vaguely alarming - who knew who had walked in off the street and was hanging about in this empty area?\n(Oh, and it bugs me when restaurants add a service charge.

Don't be surprised if those wallets are dirty and you see black stains and dust on those jeans you just found! So be prepared!

While I haven't been to Joel Robuchon (the only 3 star in Vegas), I've been to the other 2 stars and this is at least as good, probably better.\nI've been a member of Yelp for quite some time now, and this is my first review. The meal was so good I felt I needed to share.\nThe Restaurant\nA wonderfully intimate, yet whimsical, environment that's puts you in the mood for a fun evening out. There is a small bar area where you can enjoy a drink while waiting for your table. I recommend their signature cocktail, the Veuve Framboise (it's like a really good Kir Royale). Mmmm. When you arrive at your table, you might even be blessed with a view of the Bellagio fountains.\nThe Service\nLe Cirque has mastered the art of constantly checking in on your table from a slight distance to make sure everything is going well. There is nothing worse than enjoying a great meal with constant bombardment from the staff. Each member of the staff has certain roles. For example, only the sommelier refilled our wine glasses. Nice touch! Speaking of the sommelier, he suggested a great Bordeaux that was reasonably priced.\nThe Food\nNo matter how great the decor or service is, the bottom line is the food. Each dish that came out (we each had an app, entree, and dessert) was better than the last. I started with risotto that had freshly shaved truffles and champagne. One of the best risotto dishes I've ever had. In fairness, this was a fairly expensive supplement to the standard cost but well worth every penny. This was followed by a duck course that was prepared in about 3 different styles. I'm craving a return trip just for this dish! My meal ended with a chocolate souffle. Shockingly enough, it was great. ;)\nI've been to many of the top restaurants in Las Vegas, and I can say that whenever I get asked for a recommendation for high end dining in the city, Le Cirque will be the first restaurant I mention."

And so when we got got wind of Cafe de Japon, we were excited to make our way over to Desert Inn Road.\nCafe de Japon is a little different than your regular, run of the mill Japanese restaurant; in fact, it's more like Japanese Coffeehouse that you would find in Japan that serves casual comfort food, (it's not fusion-I HATE that WORD)! \nAs you can see by the front facade, this place's got a little humor, (if you can't figure out where you are... look up...directionally challenged)! As we're edging closer to the entrance, I can't help but wonder, what kind of drunken clientele do they get that needs to know where the exits are right as they walk in?\nTake a deep breath and end scene......To our relief, the restaurant interior is a normal looking cafe, with an inordinate amount of Japanese customers, (always a good sign)! We got seated and started looking at the items on the menu.\nAnd there was a lot, including the specials board. Reading about their menu online, there was a lot of buzz about their Hamburg Steak, their Pasta with Mentaiko (fish egg) Sauce and Hayashi Rice.\nTo start off the meal, we ordered the Yuzu Soda- a refreshing drink of Yuzu (japanese citrus fruit) syrup and bits of Yuzu rind, soda and a secret ingredient that the waitress wouldn't reveal. In any case, it was the first time I've ever had this drink and boy, it was GOOD! In a Kerr Mason jar, the portion was great! I would come back just for that drink!\nFor Lunch, there was a set course menu for $15 which included a small salad, entree and the dessert with Siphon Coffee. We were psyched that they served this style of coffee and since the waiter said the dessert was Tiramisu, it was a no brainer!!!\nWe added a small Tapas style appetizer to our set lunch- the Pork Belly, served with Cresson and Ginger, it was sandwiched in a flakey pie crust- definitely a french touch. It was an ok Pork Belly, not bad but I would try something else the next time.....\nFor our main entrees, I ordered the Tororin (melt in our mouth) Omelet with Rice; a tomato based fried rice with chicken and fresh, house made Tomato Sauce on top of an soft runny Omelet.\nThis is an absolute comfort food dish that whipped me back into my childhood....And I don't remember it being this good! The tomato in the fried rice was sweet and tart at the same time, combined with the chicken and omelet, you couldn't satisfy your senses more than with this dish!\nThe other entrees that we ordered was the Hamburg Steak Japanese Style- with created Daikon (Radish) and Shiso (Japanese Sarsaparilla), served with potato wedges on a sizzling plate.\nTo be totally honest, this was not my favorite dish. My recollection of hamburg steak is closer to a meatloaf-like soft consistency with the grated daikon added to the mushy texture. This however, was overcooked and tough to cut, much less chew. The Potato Wedges were fabulous tho, but alas, couldn't make up for the two boulders of ground cow that lay dead before us.....next time, I'll hop on over to Red Rock and gnaw on gravel..\nAlas, one dish was a thumbs up, and one not so up.. But with the end of the meal coming to a close, the finale approached with promise and renewed hope. The tiramisu came, and although the portion was tiny, it was an incredibly creamy and delicious dessert. The siphon coffee came and I disappointed to see that the coffee already came in the mug, (I thought that it would be prepared at the table). But looking back at the coffee bar, I realized that everything was made there. Albeit my disappointment, it was a great cup of coffee- I enjoyed the aroma and taste and would most likely come back here for an afternoon pick me up!\nOverall, it's a place worth trying a couple of times to explore all their dishes; not all of them hit it out of the ballpark, but when you get that one dish that does, boy, are you gonna chase that dragon!!!!\nRating (Out of Five Stars)\nFood 3\nAmbience 1.5\nService 3\n(BTW- the ambience was 1.5, because there was no ambience. Not a bad thing, just nonexistent....But it got the .5 because of the dishware, like the Kerr Mason Jar and Siphon Contraption at the Bar)."

They sell wine by the glass and by the bottle, and the prices vary from reasonable to expensive. They also have a small section for wine knick knacks, like wine stoppers, etc. Selection is limited and small, prices are okay. They have some glassware as well, and some of it is really expensive...I saw a wine decanter for like $125!! yikes. \nI reccomend this place for a variety of reasons. First, the staff is awesome, and are totally educated. Its a wonderfully relaxed enviroment, and its someplace you can go by yourself too, take a date, or just meet up with people for wine or beer. clean, nice etc. Its a wonderfully relaxing place to spend any evening.\nThe down side? Don't bother eating here. Stick to the wine when going. Food here, I think, is okay, and overpriced. Its a wine bar, not a resturant. Also, I think they lack variety in things other then wines, like glassware which you can get at Ikea or Walmart anyways.\nPlus, the owner lady is always there. She has short hair and is rather loud. She knows her stuff tho."

Not ONCE did either of the desk clerks say, \"I'll be right with you.\" We stood there for 25 minutes after having had a three hour delay in Atlanta and a four hour flight, plus another hour in baggage claim and in line at the car rental place. When we got upstairs, I did my standard bed bug check. THERE WAS FOOD BEHIND THE BED!! The carpet looked like it hadn't been vaccumed. I asked for another room and was DOWNGRADED. This room had sugar or salt strewn all over a bench seat, which had pooled in the button. The bathroom was not cleaned well. I cried. Then, the next day I asked for yet another room. This room was slighly better, but had mildew buildup around the drain. At that point, I just gave up. Next time, we'll stay at the Luxor."

Unlike the AMC Esplanade, which forces you to choose movie times based on the Fork and Screen or more plush (and more expensive) Cinema Suites experience, iPic offers both in the same theater. You can opt for premium recliner seats that come with a blanket, pillow, and complimentary small popcorn, or the regular seating closer to the front, which is less plush and doesn't come with anything, including service. Haven't tried the food here yet, but the drinks are good. Service is decent, and what you'd expect for a bunch of servers who are plodding around in the dark trying to quietly distribute the correct orders to people they can barely see. Expect to pay for your experience, but if you're looking for the best luxury theater experience, this is it."

The restaurant reminded me of Sauce, but the quality of the pizza and ingredients left much to be desired. \nPizza Me! offers unlimited toppings, which sounds good on the surface, but I found the ones I got to be lacking in taste. The pizza itself has an ultra thin crust that tasted more like cardboard than pizza. It had a bit of an aftertaste too, and I felt the need to have something else to get rid of it.\nThe dining area had issues too. The sun hits this place without anything to block it, so it is difficult to find a table where you are not somewhat bothered by it. The floor was dirty, and the tables didn't look that clean either.\nIf this is not enough to consider staying away, it is worth noting that the pizza comes in one size only, 11 inches, so no option for getting just slices and not really something that you would have enough left over to take home. We actually had a piece of pizza left and decided it was better to throw it out than bother to take it home."

Anticipating the usual question 'Can I start you guys off with something to drink' I order an RC cola and my buddy does the same. She recommends the Cheeseburger so thats what we get.

It says something (not good) when I feel like, upon leaving the hotel, that I would have been better off sleeping on his couch!\nFirst of all this is not the cheapest place to stay in the Champaign-Urbana area so I would have expected something at the very least decent. While the general appearance of the property and the rooms is acceptable that is where it ends.\nWhile check in went fairly smoothly and the clerk friendly it did a bit of waiting before they got to me. Generally I wouldn't have even mentioned the wait but the rest of my experience was so bad that I figure I might as well throw all the punches.\nThere is a large interior lobby area with what I believe was an open restaurant, a fountain, maybe a bar and I don't know what all. But the point being was a large open space with people gathering. The rooms were either exterior (with windows facing the outside) or interior (with windows facing the lobby). I had the unfortunate luck of getting an interior room. While the lobby has a mostly glass ceiling and gets light from those, the interior rooms are also expected to get their light from the lobby skylights. I felt claustrophobic! \nOn top of the light situation there are so many reasons for people to be in this lobby that all you hear are people partying all night! When I mentioned the noise at check out in the morning they said \"well we had a wedding\". That's not my problem, I came for a decent night's sleep and didn't get one.\nFinal note on the rooms, the pillows were awful, just all bulgy and bumpy and plain uncomfortable. \nAt check out there was only one staff member at the desk and she was on the phone. I waited for at least ten minutes, during which time she didn't even glance up to indicate that she would be with me in moment.\nI know that I will have occasion to stay in the Champaign-Urbana area again but would never ever stay here!"

I've visited about a dozen times for breakfast and will continue to be a regular. I haven't had lunch or dinner there yet, but I suspect that the food and service would be consistent with their top-notch breakfast.\nThe staff is friendly and attentive. After a few visits, it was clear that they recognized us and gave us even warmer welcomes. It seems like they genuinely enjoy their jobs.\nI've had the crepes with blueberries and marscapone (only $6 - take that, Crackers) a couple of times. The fruit is fresh and the crepes are perfectly cooked. It's sweet but wonderfully executed.\nLately I've stuck with eggs for breakfast - either the $5 breakfast sandwich on an English muffin with a generous portion of potatoes, or two eggs (I take mine poached, which they do in the traditional style, so no added fat) with potatoes and sausage for about $7. I'm not a fan of potatoes, but I love what they do with them for breakfast. They are oven roasted, slightly crispy, with roasted and almost caramelized onions. The taste is fantastic.\nI do have a couple of complaints that I hope the owners will work on:\n1) Buy some good (hot) tea options. You are a nice restaurant and should have something other than Lipton plain black. Invest in a variety pack with herbal and green teas, plus Earl Grey.\n2) Replace your ceiling vents. They're disturbingly unattractive."

Apparently our order was never put in from the server or there was some sort of \"computer malfunction' they claimed, but we waited at the table for 45 minutes after ordering, no food, nothing. The server obviously recognized the mistake and kept checking in with us and apologized for the unusually long wait, (did I mention the restaurant was half empty, I wonder why!) and she did offer to comp our coffee drinks. But the infuriating part was when we finally complained to the manager because we could not figure out why the ridiculously long wait, she came over to our table, did not properly introduce herself, sat down and pointed to the man-held computer system and TOLD US we had only been waiting 15 minutes. Really?!? You're coming over to tell us how long we have been waiting??? It was so rude and disrespectful, she was trying to argue her point to us which clearly showed that the server did not put in our order immediately which is probably why the server apologized to us umpteen times!!! It was the most ridiculous display of what NOT to do as a manager. I have been in management and customer service for over 12 years and this was clearly a Management 101 mistake. She never apologized or tried to rectify the situation, but when you come out to your customers in fighting mode you really cannot rectify that! \n Needless to say, unless this restaurant starts to provide better training to their managers and team members, or hires a new manager, we will NOT be coming back here again."

I went with a group of 7 friends on opening day and we were able to get a reservation simply based on our positions at various hotels around the valley, and saw a 30 minute wait after our 8:30PM reservation, which was ok seeing as they squoze us in. When I pulled up, I was amazed at all the vehicles in the valet lot, so I kept driving and parked around the corner. The place made me feel small from the beginning!\nThe entire space is beautiful and very well done. It's hip, yet upscale, and a very fun atmosphere. The servers are very friendly even though some of them are not fully trained in the restaurant. The food I had was delicous. Tuna on fried brown rice cake was delicious, as was the salmon and toro sushi. The yakatori sticks were very bland and almost seemed as though they were done with a greek seasoning, rather than a sweet Japanese. The food did come out quickly, even on a day when the place was packed way over capacity. Drinks, however, were not so quick. I had 2 greyhounds @ 14 each and I swear neither of them had any alcohol in them and have heard similar grumblings from others as well. I have to assume their bartenders have previous experience from other places, but it didn't seem as such. I heard a LOT of smashed glasses as well. The whole night seemed like a mess for them.\nThe restrooms were very cool, if not a bit confusing. They told me to go in through the door to the restrooms and I saw a lot of women standing around and figured I was headed for the womens room. But infact the men and women share the communal sinks and waiting areas, but have their own bathroom area, which was different. I feel the atmosphere was definitely typical Scottsdale but a little different in some areas where it was obvoius they put some neat touches in it. \nI had one major gripe with the place, a little out of the restaurants control, was the overzealous attitude of their loss prevention department. These guys thought they were professional bouncers at Las Vegas night clubs. We had been going back and forth between the restaurant and the lobby all night with no problems. At one point a big black guy said I cant come in, and this was after my whole party just went in front of me. I said \"look count chocula, I've been in here all night, and all of my friends just walked by you. Don't stand there and tell me your hands are tied or you are over capicaty or something like that, because I know it is bs. I'm going past you.\" His co-worker came over and told him to let me in. The guy would have beat me into the ground if he had wanted to but it worked out. \nThey need to get their security department going in a proper fashion, and work on the bar quite a bit, and the place will be a real winner. I'm sure that it will come with time, so I'm giving it 4 stars under the assumption that it is going to improve in time."

I had the salmon spread with a side of avocado and an extra bagel for about $8. The spreads come with fruit, which in this case was two pieces of melon. My only complaint is that my avocado wasn't as fresh as it could have been, and one part of it was brown and inedible, but I had so much spread leftover that I wasn't overly concerned.

There is one thing you can count on with this restaurant, on any busy weekend when Dillon's is packed you can always walk right in and get a table here. That's your first sign that something just isn't right. And, that should be Waterfront's sign that something is terribly wrong. \nIt only goes downhill from there. Each time we have gone the service is ssssllllloooowww. I have never been able to understand why that is, it's not because they are busy. Dillon's is busy and their service is great. \nThe food has always been just OK, except this last time we went, which, by the way, is the last time we will ever go. I had some family in from out of town for Memorial Day Weekend and that Saturday I took a group to the lake for some wake boarding. At lunchtime we went to Dillon's, it was packed with an hour + wait time. So, we hopped in the boat and went to Pleasant Harbor. Not only did we have slow service, but by sister had mold in her salad and they screwed up our food order. Then, they screwed up our bill. \nAny time that I have had a problem with food quality or billing problems at any other restaurant the staff and management will usually make an effort to make it right by either replacing the food or taking that particular item off the bill. Not here! The waitress did say \"sorry\". \nI contacted Ben, the manager, the following week on the phone. He explained that they had recently taken over the operation of the marina and restaurant, and were working to make some changes. I told Ben about our experiences, and he had asked that I send him an email outlining the problems and that he would email back some coupons for some freebies. I figured if I got some coupons I would go back towards the end of the summer to give them time to iron out the problems. That was over a week ago and I have not heard back. And, the email didn't bounce back, so I guess that they just don't care.\nAs I told Ben, this place has so much potential. Look at Dillon's!!! Their food is good, not spectacular, although some of their waitresses are spectacular. But their service is great. This could be a really cool waterfront bar & grill. It has the ambiance and the dock space. \nUnless I hear otherwise, I am done trying to give Waterfront Bar & Grill second, third and fourth chances. 15 years ago it used to be pretty good. That was then and this is now. I did provide what I thought was constructive criticism. I do wish them the best."

The outside architecture is awesome. I can appreciate the design, however the seats are extremely uncomfortable and dated and the bathrooms are a horror. I shudder every time there is intermission because I know what is next. I cannot believe that such a large place has only a couple of bathrooms. I hope they do something about it."

You'll never see me set foot in Wal-Mart, and Target beckons me with its red glowing signs in the night.\nThis is the closest Target to my house, but it leaves a bit to be desired. First problem: I always get lost inside. The layout is different from the stores I'm used to, and I get turned around as soon as the registers are out of sight. Need to find trash bags? Good luck, but at least the guys in the electronics department are used to that question and can help out.\nWe found some great after-Christmas deals and stocked up on other necessities to get the biggest bang for our gift card bucks. At the register, I presented four reusable bags. One was Target brand, the other three were Fry's, Bashas and Disney. Still, the cashier initially tried to sell us the bags. Easy mistake. But this poor cashier remained befuddled about the bags and floundered the whole way through the checkout process. Each item he put in was a mystery. Food items and toiletries alike were mixed up with no rhyme or reason. The bags had to be reexamined with each scan. The only concern he had was if the large package of toilet paper might fit in one of the bags, which was truly unnecessary. As he fumbled with a long, awkward item trying to get the square peg into the round hole, my fiance took it from him and put it in a different bag. \"Oh.... ok\" was our friend's response, as he stared at the bag some more. This was when I noticed his name tag said \"trainer\". This guy trains people? That made me sad. I'd really hoped he was new.\nAt the end, he failed to give us the 5 cent bag credit, thank us for coming in, or acknowledge our departure at all. Not cool, Target Eric. Not cool."

I hated AZ88 for no aparent reason for a long time. I tend to hate things that young hip kids who live in Scottsdale enjoy, just as a rule, so I was sure I would hate this place. I totally didn't. Part of what I loved about it was those ridiculous sparkling dogs though. Seriously the food is super delicious and I always worry myself sick about what to order cause will it be as delicious as Elsa Chicken Sandwhich? Also, how much do you love waffle cut fries? Well I don't know how much you love them, but I love them a lot. And this place is a little classier than Chik-fil-a, the only other place I know that serves waffle cut fries. Even though it is in Scottsdale and hip kids like it, it isn't even retardedly overpriced. You should probably go here if you haven't yet. Those good for check boxes remind me that the Golden Gate cake thing is beyond delicious. Order it."

They were apparently moving over to a spot in Chinatown (now open!) and I would have to wait a couple more weeks. While on a taco trek UYE last week I was told that SnowFlake Shavery would be added as one of our stops and was thrilled! This isn't ice cream and it isn't a sno-cone. I know there is a lot of confusion to what shave ice is and I am learning myself, but you wont find any artificial syrups here! If you haven't had it before, it is something you need to experience first hand. The appearance, texture and taste is something special. SnowFlake Shavery uses fresh and all natural ingredients. Flavors range from chocolate, vanilla, cantaloupe, mango, coconut, green tea, black sesame and depending on the season you might be lucky enough to try the banana! I missed out, but heard it was fantastic! \nSizes: Regular ($3.49) Large ($4.75) Monster ($6.49)\nStep 1 - Choose your flavor and size\nStep 2 - Choose your toppings priced 50 cents each\nStep 3 - Choose sauce priced at 25 cents each (first sauce is free) \nI ordered the \"Ex-Straw-Binary\" (regular) and it had strawberry snow, strawberries, strawberry sauce and I had them add chocolate sprinkles and extra strawberry condensed milk. The strawberry condensed milk is SO good! The shave ice is very light. The portions are big and even though the regular looks like something you wont be able to finish, give it a try because it wasn't filling at all to me. It was just refreshing and yummy. I will be back to try other flavors!\nThe employees are very friendly and willing to answer any questions you might have. If you aren't sure about a flavor just ask and they will give you a sample. Don't forget to ask for a rewards card because when you buy 10 you get one free!"

It's tucked away in a parking lot on the Southeast corner of Eastern and Sahara, where Subway is located. Here, you will delight yourself in flavorful dishes, of Spanish and Amerindian influences; authentic in it's preparation, made by friendly people. The pupusas here, are delicious and taste great the next day. I enjoyed their yuca con chicharron, pastelitos, and other dishes. They always have fresh fruit beverages, like tamarindo and guanabana, plus Salvadoran horchata, and most importantly, friendly staff. Which in my opinion , are ingredients for a nice experience."

The hotel lobby is a bit off the Strip, but has just as much panache and grandeur of some more popular locations... And the Envy Steakhouse? It was fantastic.\nOur party of two really pigged out: bone in rib eye, lobster macaroni, truffle fries, and calamari...\nThe appetizers were great price and easily shared for two, if not three people. At $7 a plate, they were a steal! \nTHE CALAMARI was uniquely crunchy but with perfectly cooked squid. The dipping sauces (sweet and cocktail) were a rich flavor that contrasted nicely with the lemon-sprinkled rings of calamari.\nTHE TRUFFLE FRIES and LOBSTER MACARONI were the usual restaurant expectations; the fries were a bit crispy since they were shoestring sized. The lobster Mac&cheese was a bit over seasoned with salt, and I would have preferred a spicier cheese to the mild mix they used. Regardless, both dishes were delicious at $7 a pop.\nThe BONE-IN RIBEYE was excellent. Perfectly medium rare (is there any other way?), salted along the bone and fatty sides, and a beautiful cut. Not the best rib eye in the world, but very impressive and delicious. Definitely worth a try at least once. It gives the \"steakhouse\" part of the name some credibility, since everything else we had ordered were appetizers. Comes with a side of garlic mashed potatoes and brussels sprouts. The mashed potatoes were a tad salty on their own, but delicious with the steak.\nOverall, a great experience with excellent service. With or without a Groupon, I would visit again.\nPROTIP: complementary valet parking on site, and great for a nice quiet couples dinner."

Wicked Spoon is located in the Cosmopolitan Hotel, which if you're unfamiliar, is a relatively new and very chic hotel. They play up their chic ambiance in the buffet too. The space itself is lovely. Plush comfortable seating, tables are close but not uncomfortably close. You feel almost like you're in a lounge rather than a buffet. But do not fret, friends, the food is there just waiting for consumption by the masses. \nAt Wicked Spoon, it's about presentation as well as. Their food is presented in small plates, single serve portions, as well as more self-service options. There is a salad station with a variety of small plated salads, charcuterie, pasta station, brunch food (I was there for brunch), Asian station, carving station, and a very large dessert station. Everything we ate was delicious; I can't remember every single dish but I will name my favorites. Watermelon salad with balsamic vinegar, pesto, and garnished with Mascarpone cheese, pasta with braised beef short ribs, bacon cured in house, sushi, and Angry Mac and Cheese (mac and cheese with a kick). I appreciated the small portions of the food. I was able to indulge and try multiple dishes without feeling terribly guilty. Dessert was amazing. They have different types of ice creams, gelatos, cakes, and cookies. I had the Thai ice cream- tastes just like Thai Ice Tea and gingerbread. \nAt $42.00/ person for brunch, it is probably one of the more expensive buffets on the strip. For $10 more you can upgrade for bottomless mimosas, champagne, or a Bloody Mary. Not bad overall."

All of it not good!\nWe started off with the bottomless chips and salsa. This was the only good thing about the experience. I also checked in on Foursquare and noticed I got a free bottomless chips and salsa with check-in I asked our waitress about it. She had no clue about it at all. She even said that she had never seen it before and had me read her off the coupon code. The chips were surprisingly light and very tasty and the salsa was pretty fresh. \nFor lunch I decided to have their new Bacon Avocado Chicken Sandwich. It came on a pretzel bun, with tiny bits of sauteed onion, very none existent cilantro pesto mayo and fries. It looked really pretty and looked like it was going to be really yummy. Alas, I was wrong. So very tasteless! The whole thing just had no flavor and needed some serious sauce. I tasted none of the mayo at all. Even the fries tasted bad. \nMy Mom ordered the Southern Smokehouse Bacon Burger. Again, it looked really yummy and was huge, but was flavorless. She also said it was mushy in the middle and the ancho-chilie BBQ sauce was not on there at all!\nWhen the sever brought us our food we asked for a couple of sides of ranch for our fries. She said no problem. I ate half of my sandwich and had given up on the ranch and was using ketchup before we finally got our ranch. Both of our fries were cold by the time it came and then it wasn't even our server that brought it to us! \nChili's you disappointed me. From your servers to your food: meh!

Check.\nThey have an crazy selection of single malts, including rare bottlings (Gordon & MacPhail et al.) It's so big there's a binder for it. Pours of the good stuff were about 5 to 7 pounds. Ales the usual 2 to 3 pound.\nThe barkeeps are great at multitasking and did a good job at turning away drunk blaggards (of which there are many roaming about this part of town) while advising us on what scotches to try given our particular tastes and budget. One of them was even a half-Japanese girl from Oregon studying in Edinburgh -- proving that it is hard to get away from the US even in Scotland. :)\nAll in all this is obviously a place that the locals cherish (we were pointed out to the same old drunkard who comes at least once a week and has 5-6 drams of scotch in a sitting, but is totally harmless) and I definitely cherish it too. I miss it already!"

Usually when you walk into other hotels and casinos, the first thing you smell is Cigarette smoke (which is digusting), and you leave smelling like to too. When you walk into the Palazzo, it literally smells like roses. That sold me before I even saw the room. When we got to the room, it was beautiful. There are 3 flat screen televisons in the room: one in the living room, one in the bedroom area, and one in the bathroom. When I looked out the window, I got this amazing view of the strip. The hotel and casino are also not as overcrowded as the other places, so it was quite pleasant to walk around there. I love this hotel!!!"

Nothing. \n1 star\nTo be fair I had their regular fried chicken another time and that tasted ok, not A-OK great but passable - maybe 2.5 stars. \nThe surprise here was the waffle potatoes, they tasted of .... potatoes! Not great stuff mind you, nobody will line up for these fries but in this day and age when the most popular fries fries in the world are artificially flavored and coated reconstituted potato by-product I thought that was an improvement\n3 stars. \nI also took home a chicken salad sandwich for my SO, I tasted it and thought it was awful! The dark bread totally overpowered the chicken salad *spread* honestly it was more like velveta than a proper salad with chicken morsels in it. It was already 3 pm and my SO's was too starved not to eat it, but I don't foresee her asking for another one ever ... again. \nNO stars.\nWhy 3 stars then? \nBecause right there on the billboard was the calorie count so you couldn't miss seeing it when you order, and I think it's high time all the peddlers of fake foods did this."

    "text": "I would give this Capital Grille location no stars if possible. I don't mean to be harsh, but I expect A LOT more out of restaurants that charge this much for their food. My mom, brother, boyfriend and I visited Capital Grille, mid-May, for an early birthday dinner for myself. We have never dined at a Capital Grille, but have been to the Palm several times, as well as BLT Steak restaurant group. This was our first experience and last one. We wasted almost $500 on this horrendous dining experience. Number one, we ordered a bottle of wine, it literally took our server, Ken, around 20 minutes to find the bottle of wine in their cellar. We were seated near the cellar where he was searching for the bottle, and watched him. At one point he became flustered and went to check on another table. Finally, he came to table with the wine. My brother and boyfriend started with the French Onion soup, it was decent, but overpriced for what it is. I started with the Lobster Bisque, which had to be sent back because it was cold and had butchered overcooked lobster floating on top. Ken returned with a proper bisque at the correct temperature, also decent but overpriced. My mom had the Spinach salad, very small portion, and the knife cuts were a joke. Mushrooms sliced at different widths, onions, some sliced thin, some sliced thick. Mediocre at best. We didn't even mention the salad until the end of the meal, when things had just become too much. The excuse we received was that this was the \"corporate recipe\", this is how corporate wants the vegetables sliced, in random different sizes, isn't it about presentation, especially when you pay this much? My brother ordered the Dry Aged Porterhouse, my mom ordered the Kona Crusted Dry Aged Bone In Sirloin, and I ordered the Delmonico. We also ordered their \"signature\" potato gratin, creamed spinach, and the Truffle Fries. Unimpressed in the quality and flavor of meat, I'm not sure if they were even serving Prime that day. Maybe a corporate decision? The gratin was a joke, topped with crushed potato flakes, seriously? Creamed spinach mediocre. The Fries were very good actually, but how can you mess up fries? The most disappointing and shocking moment is when Ken tried to argue with my boyfriend that the steak her ordered, the Dry Aged Steak Au Poivre, which he ordered rare, and came out medium, was rare, until he took to the kitchen and put it under the light. Then comes back to tell us that the salad is on them since we hated it, which my mom only said that it wasn't the best and it wasn't the worst spinach salad she has had. They gave us an on the house coconut cream pie to go. Which I took one bite when I got home and threw it away. Very disappointing when you spend this much money and receive this type of service and quality of food. We might as well set $500 on fire."

Fairly certain I also saw it had won some \"Best Barbeque\" awards for the area. My hopes were high, but after trying it, I was terribly let down.\nThe barbeque this place serves reminds me of very average cafeteria style food. I'll say I definitely thought the meat was very good.. (I have tried the chicken, pork, and beef) and it has a nice smoked taste to it. Unfortunately, everything else that makes the sandwich fails. The barbeque sauce, perhaps ultimately the most important ingredient, pretty much is what ruins the sandwich in my opinion. Like a lot of other reviews have said, the sauce is unduly sweet, and extremely watery. It almost tastes like drinking liquid sugar in some regards... \nThe bread is not much better. Sandwiches are literally served on tiny hoagie rolls like the generic ones you buy at the grocery store for $1. Probably the most generic, cheap type of bread anyone can afford... \nSides were also generally unimpressive. Baked beans were nothing special, and I also had a potato salad side that seriously had almost NO taste to it. It tasted like eating raw potatoes.\nAll and all, definitely a huge let down for me, and very sub par barbeque and sides. Really a surprise they keep winning the best Barbeque award for the CU area, but I guess there's no other competition? Sad to say, but this was probably one of the worst barbeques I've ever had."

Plus, if I just paid you $40, YOU HAD BETTER BELIEVE YOU ARE NOW MY REFERRAL. I go home unable to speak, FUMING. I find a great!!! Otolaryngologist in the coming week (Dr. John Michael Raines at the Biltmore Medical Mall) and call them to make an appointment. The understanding receptionist says its fine if the Derm Dr. refers me, since they have the most recent documents about my neck. I call the receptionist here and SHE GIVES ME ATTITUDE. (P.S. She has been working here forever and is ONLY nice when you hand her your card and ask ZERO questions). So I (nicely) continue to take no for an answer saying, I paid $40 for useless information, that I could have found out if you had told me they didn't do removal procedures, WHICH THEIR WEBSITE STATES THEY CLEARLY DO??? \nSo I didn't accept no until the receptionist, thinking this would get me off her back, said to me, \"Well you're going to have to fax us a release of information form and what to have faxed to the other office.\" (Didn't I sign an ROI form when you took me initially??? Isn't that mandated by HIPAA? But I digress.) I say \"Can I email the form to you as fax machines are kind of obsolete in most homes at the moment and I'd have to pay, yet again, to get this thing to you.\" She stated that they were not able to do that at the time, and could ONLY be faxed to them. #1 Get with the times, #2 If you're making it complicated for me, just to get me to leave you guys alone, you have sorely misjudged me. I said fine and to expect a fax within a few hours. I faxed the ridiculous ROI form I created with a scan of my ID, and emailed it away stating I wanted only my short history and any specific notes about this cyst sent to the new Dr. I sent it to my Derm and only but THREE DAYS LATER, did the specialist get the faxes from Dr. Brown's office, so that I could make the appointment.\nI got into the specialists appointment and he hands me a STACK of personal information from Dr. Browns office, 10-15 pages worth, telling me \"I don't need this, but I'll give it to you in case you need all of that.\" Laughing at the misstep Dr. Browns people had made. Learn how to release information, because I'm sure TONS of people will be wanting their records sent elsewhere. \nI am done. I put up with them for making me feel like a paycheck, for dealing with a never-nice front desk lady, for making me wait 15 minutes minimum to see a Dr., for seeing the Dr. for 3-4 minutes at times, and even for making a blanket statement about my Accutane (IT'S CALLED RESEARCH!!! I don't care if you tell me it WAS the Accutane, just don't pretend it's a miracle drug with no side effects other than birth defects.)\nBut paying $40 for a waste of a visit and then having to waste time talking to a rude desk clerk and then spend another $5 to FAX info to them is enough. I will never be going back, I will never be giving them my money again, and I will be VERY HAPPY about it. I would rather see ANOTHER 1 star Derm than come back here. \nSorry about my rant, I CLEARLY have pent up a little anger about this.\nP.S. Dr. Raines did a BEAUTIFUL job on my cyst removal and I felt well cared for and extremely comfortable before and after surgery. I will be writing him a review when the stitches are removed and I see a little more healing. : )"

Running outside in Vegas is basically asking to get ran over. If you can get past the douchey staff and management, I guess it's sufficient. It can get pretty crowded but I haven't had to wait for a treadmill in the 6 years I've been a member, so I guess it's okay. I don't know about any of the other equipment as I never use any of that. \nThe customer service here is HORRIBLE. As someone else said, they make you pay $12 for a new card, even if you've been a member forever. My old card was barely readable and I lost it recently and they still made me pay $12. It's complete BS, those blood-sucking bastards. On top of that, I asked if I could add someone in my household to my account, and the girl responded, \"I'm not sure, sorry no.\" WTF does that even mean?? So i called the corporate and they were equally stupid. There is no such thing as an add-on or family package because I've been a member for such a long time. They told me it's only for new members. That makes no EFFIN sense. \nBefore I did CrossFit, I used to do classes here, like Body Pump. What a joke. Knowing what I know now about correct form and technique, those Body Pump classes should be stopped immediately. They do NOT care about bad form and technique. It's just appalling.\nThe last super annoying thing about this gym is the crowd. There are people, like me, who are honestly just there to get a good workout and that's awesome. Then there are the super d-bags who stare at every girl who walks by, and the chicks who come completely done up with their boobs hanging out and just look ridiculous. I'm glad I only come here to bust out my 3-5 miles a day and beeline it out the door. I don't think I'd be able to work out here doing anything else without being constantly annoyed."

Shall we proceed with the review? \nI can't believe I've driven by this place so many times, and missed it's existence. Tucked away in the back corner of the shopping center featuring William Sonoma and Bricktops, you almost have to know it's there or you could miss it. \nThe service was really friendly, quick, unpretentious, and as soon as we sat down, a bowl of hot crispy chips appeared at our table, with two salsas. \nI was THRILLED with my steak and shrimp combo fajitas. The tortillas are made fresh in house. LOTS of juicy, caramelized peppers and onions, and some kind of butter melted over it for extra decadence. Plenty of toppings and goodies (which is what I love about fajitas!) mean lots of ooey-gooey-drip-down-your-hand-and-arm goodness. \nOur server also recommended the Paco's Tacos and shrimp tacos, which were also super flavorful. The brisket is smoked for 6 hours, and extra tender, perfectly seasoned...the shrimp, breaded and fried, and a bit sweet from the cabbage. If I weren't such a fajita fanatic, I would have downed both tacos. \nNotes: Lots of drink specials. Manager walked around to check up on us several times. Nice dining room area with booths and TV's...another bar area with LOTS of tequila, and another side section of dark polished wood stools...and an outdoor seating area. Next time we have friends in town, this would be a good place to have a gathering. \nBottom Line: I'm not a connoisseur of Mexican or Tex Mex or whatever Paco Taco is associated with...but it's mighty tasty, and just feels like a comfortable restaurant I'd like to come back to again and again. \nPS: Had the fried ice cream...which is good, but what I liked about it was the marshmallow fluff on the side!"

What we have found in our travels is that Mexican food varies greatly from the Chicago area to North Dakota to Denver and now Phoenix. I really enjoy seafood soup, but have not found it yet, and not here. I settled for the veggie and meatball soup which was only fair. THe street tacos were steak and mexican sausage. Taste was very good, yet they were extremely greasy, My wife ordered a chimmichanga which had the sour cream and quacamole she loves. Everything was smothered in sauce and topped with a mound of sour cream. THe rice and beans were the standard fare served at every Mexican restaurant. She said it was okay but not great, The best part of our experience was our service. THe staff was very attentive and our drinks were kept full without asking, Even now I don't know why the place is always packed after eating there, One thing I am learning about the Phoenix food scene is that overall food seems to be not on par with what I've had back both in the east and midwest and is generally overpriced, Overall I'd give Phoenix 2 stars so far for food, but our search continues for good food at fair prices."

So I pulled my car around so that I might be able to stay awake long enough to make it to my redeye flight back to Chicago. Both the coffee and the music helped me achieve that goal. The staff were these young kids...well, probably in their twenties, all of whom had big smiles on their faces and were moving to the music, and wait for it...not ignoring their customers in the process! A staff of young, fun employees who know how to work and have fun at the same time. And my caramel coffee latte was delicious! And since they knew it was my first time, they gave me a punch card with 11 of the 12 punches already stamped so as soon as I buy one more, the next one is free. I like that! Since I don't live in town, I gave it to my dad who will certainly be using it now. :) I also really liked how they make smoothies, slushies and coffee drinks, so there is something for everyone.

    "text": "Ladies and gentlemen, may I present to you the greatest sushi I have ever had in my life. I lived on Japanese food for many years, but even I have to vouch for this place, despite its location in America, in the middle of the freakin' desert of all places.\nWhen I say this, I am talking about the quality of the food, the system of pricing, and the accessibility of the restaurant itself. Everything is to the advantage of the customer, which makes me wonder how this place stays in business.\nFirst of all, quality. I don't know how they manage to keep the raw fish that fresh this far inland, but they make it work. The fish tastes like it was caught that morning. The fact that they make everything to order and slice the fish in front of you certainly guarantees a product right at the threshold of optimal quality. I ordered from all over the menu, but after a couple bites of the salmon nigiri, I have to say that this is my favorite. It's a real basic menu item that was exceptionally tasty and needed little or no soy sauce to enjoy. The seared salmon is pretty good, too, in case you're in the mood for something a little more cooked, but definitely try the salmon.\nSecondly, the price. Currently, the All-You-Can-Eat Lunch price is $21.95. Normally it ends up costing that much anyway for a full meal when you order over the counter for a fresh cut, so an all-you-can-eat for that price is pretty insane. There were a few things that I probably would have never ordered À la carte like the Mexican Rolls, but because I didn't have to worry about overspending on a gamble of taste, I was able to try an atypical variety of sushi adapted for the American palate. I never found anything I didn't like, however, and we probably tried a quarter of the menu over the course of two visits to the same Sushi Mon. Mind you, it is a big menu.\nLastly, the accessibility of the location. The Western Sahara Avenue location is far off the Las Vegas Strip, so it keeps the hoards of tourists away. On the two occasions my dad and I came here, parking was not an issue, and neither was seating. The only drawback is that for any all-you-can-eat order, you are restricted to a certain time limit. I suggest coming here on a weekday off-peak so that you can order without having to worry about long waits. When it gets busy, it can become difficult to flag down the sushi chef.\nWhatever their secret is, I hope the same Sushi Mon will always be there whenever I visit Vegas (the last time I was here was in August of 2012). It tops my list of favorite restaurants and is certainly worthy of being my 100th establishment to review. Thank you, Sushi Mon!!\nCheck out their website for more info here: http://www.sushi-mon.com/"

Muffin, mushrooms, spinich and wonderfully poached eggs that look like mounds of sour cream. Perfect! My wife had 3 egg breakfast or something basic like that, also good. Try the Venitian Eggs!"

The theaters are spacious, with seats that are unexpectedly comfortable and spaced out (plus, you don't have to worry for someone's head blocking you, for the rows are evened out pretty nicely).\nNot once have I came through Rave having a shoe of mine stick to the ground, or finding trash under the seats. They keep this place in top maintenance, and it makes for the experience because I'm a person who personally cannot stand knowing the floor below me is a mess from the previous movie!\nThe location is in reach of all the bars surrounding Rave, as well as restaurants to get a quick bite to eat if you're not too fond of munching on typical theater snacks. I can definitely advocate this place for tourists, since you'll get a mixture of interesting people, a lively environment in Vegas, and for the service and cleanliness Rave has to offer!"

Lots of great equipment including hammer strength, plates, dumbells, cable racks, benches, and a smith machine. A nice amount of treadmills and cardio machines too.\nSpa is relaxing and clean, with a large hot tub, steam room, and a full list of spa and massage services. Good hours as it is open from 6AM to 6PM. As with most all casino health clubs there is a charge to use them, even if you are staying there. Cost to use the gym is $20 a day, or $25 for a three day pass which is perfect for business travelors.\nNo reason to miss a workout while you are here on vacation.

Plus they only had 3 stars when i looked over the yelp reviews, I wanted to help improve that......Big mistake .....I should've listened to my fellow yelpers. I decided to have my birthday dinner here on a friday, we decided we would meet early for happy hour then move to dining area for dinner. Well my small party of 4 got there around 6:15pm, we thought it was just in time to put in a quick order for cheap food and drinks, but it took forever to find an available server, one guy stopped by and said he'll be \"back in a sec\" but never did. So we decided to move to the patio where we thought it would be easier to put in our order, the lady taking orders was nice enough to put our order in 2 minutes before it ended. We were rushed and didnt even have the HR menus to look over because they guy never gave us them and there weren't any on the patio table. She was also pretty slow at getting them, i'm sure we would've had 4 minutes to order if she knew the urgency of HR ending at 6:30pm!! Come on now.....There were alot of older people and it got pretty dead after HR ended..\nAfter that we moved to the dining area where other members of our party met us. The menu looked good from the pictures and description they gave....but the beer selection was very limited. :( White ale, red ale, dark ale??? ok.. at least put some personality into naming them and make sure your server is educated on each beer.\nOver all the food sucked and beer sucked. No taste in either one.. It was a sad birthday dinner, yes i ate all my food because i was starving! I didnt get sick so that's good.... We had one beer/drink each and regreted the beer choice after the first sip, we left right away to get a real drink. Oh I did have a choice of either a free cake or drink for my Bday, I chose the carrot cake.. it was good, not the best. She just sat it down on the table said happy birthday then walked off......uh thanks yay happy birthday to me... oh and she charged us for the cake.. but corrected it after we mentioned it.\n I know better now to stick with the good ol' Four Peaks Brewery for GREAT Food and Beer! They have an extensive selection of beer to choose from, even if it isn't made in their brewery!\nServers/ hostess were nice, except for mr. invisable... \nJust dont go....maybe for HR but you wont taste much:(\n*Excuse my spelling and sentences, just so much happened and I can't think right trying to get it all out!"

Yesterday I was contacted personally by Matt, the owner of Butt Out, who kindly offered me an apology for the bad experience, asked me to give him details of what happened and told me that he would do everything to resolve the issue immediately in the best way possible.\nAfter explaining what happened, Matt promised me to find out what went wrong with my order, apologized repeatedly for neglecting my facebook message and also went further and offered me an immediate reward for what happened. What did he do, you ask? Amaze me! that's what he did. He not only upgrade my order to the double of what I originally ordered but also he personally brought it to my house!!! and the best part It is not said yet... he gave me an eleaf istick mod with an aspire nautilus tank!

I know my mistake as costumer was perhaps that I did not contacted him/them directly by phone before disputing the charge with my bank (I am not a phone calls person) but definitely the moral of this story is that when you have a similar problem with any business, call them, because sometimes the messages get lost among other messages the business get (spam) as it was in my case.\nThank you very much Matt / Butt Out, you ROCK!\nMiriam *.~"

I would suggest passing on this unless they change the recipe to include more crab (not krab, please!).\nSalmon entree was pretty good and cooked to the temperature requested; a good portion for the price paid, but what really made this dish stand out are the Brussel sprouts...ask for those with any other entree; they're that good.\nChicken entree was thin and not all that flavorful but a decent portion. This entree came with a salad that had a fantastic vinaigrette (I believe) but the leaves were too roughage-like for me and somewhat bitter. \nCreme brulee was done nicely and what you'd expect; it's hard to screw up custard with caramelized sugar. \nThe highlight of the meal was the tiramisu. This was fantastic and not over-done in the rum department as most places do. I will go back for this alone, with maybe a cordial to wash it down since they have a full bar as well. \nAmbiance: If it's busy, as it was on my visit, it's far too loud in this small space due to a lack of acoustical panels or other noise dampening decor. Yes, I understand I'm sitting in a 'storage container', but several things can be done to make the space not so harsh. That annoys me while dining out more than bad service. Please look into taming down the space considerably. \nService: Excellent from both the server and the manager who checked on the table twice. From the minute I walked in I felt like all staff truly cared about the patrons. They were happy to be there; that makes me happy to be there too. \nOverall it's worth a stop by if you're in the area since the dining options (that I would recommend at least) are somewhat limited on East Fremont.

You won't get the white tablecloth but you will have an extra $50 in your pocket when you leave and be just as satisfied."

We've actually given them a ton of business, and I'm sure will continue to do so considering we enjoy the quality of their food, the portion sizes, convenience, the service, etc... oh yeah - and the fact that they are healthy too!\nSure, it can be pricey, and I advise only purchasing what you know you'll eat within a few days. We've had a few instances where the food sits too long and goes past expiration date and goes to waste. But, when you plan ahead, MFF really is fabulous.\nSome of our favorite dishes:\n*Breakfast: protein pancakes and oat bakes - our toddler loves the pancakes and I love the oat bakes!\n*Lunch / Dinner: I enjoy most of the salmon and chicken dishes. The cobb and/or greek salads aren't bad either. My husband is also a fan of Denyse's Killuh Chili; I have yet to try it though.\n*Snacks: almond butter crunch / fit-to-go\n***I'm not a big fan of the bars or cookies, and I don't recommend the wrap sandwiches either. I do however love that they sell Chobani yogurt. It's my favorite but I purchase it at the grocery store.\nAs soon as this baby arrives and I'm ready to get fit and drop the lbs I've been putting on, I may consider one of MFF's 21 day challenges. Let me know if you're interested in joining me!"

It's a testament to the diversity of Montreal that in a Chinese restaurant you can hear so many different languages spoken. \nI should have known to retreat and flee the scene when the waiter yelled to me, after asked if they have bottled water, \"Across the street!\" and motioning to some other establishment.\nThere was enough oil and grease on the initial spring roll to have been left over from the BP spill.\nThe shrimp ball soup was actually tasty and was the highlight of the meal (not including our exit, of course).\nThe fried shrimp was way too salty and left a bad aftertaste in my mouth.\nThe rice that accompanied our main course of chicken consisted of shrimp, pork and peas. The peas were barely defrosted, as in, I could still taste the freezer.\nOur chicken was tough, stringy and obviously a cheap cut. \nPoor service combined with sub-par food makes for a 1 star review. Fortunately the aftertaste of this place was washed away by the gourmet food festival going on at Poinet-a- Calliere museum."

Then add the fact that the place is bright, spotless, and got an A grade by the health department makes it almost unreal for a Vietnamese restaurant. By no means am I criticizing the businesses of my people, but most of the places I use to frequent in LA were C grade.\nPho MaiLan is a breathe of fresh air. The open feel and spread out dining area is a welcoming touch. \nTo start my friend and I got an order of spring rolls ($4.95). They were two fat rolls filled with lettuce, mint, noodles, boiled pork, and shrimp. It was nice to bite into them and not come out with a mouthful of noodles. The peanut sauce comes with pickled daikon and carrots. It tastes even better with a spoonful of the chili sauce. \nInstead of getting Pho, I saw that they had a vermicelli rice noodle bowl filled with all my favorites. The Bun MaiLan Dac Biet ($8.50) was the perfect way to try a little of everything. The lemongrass pork was tender, flavorful, and plenty. If that was not enough, there was an eggroll, two pieces of grilled meat, a couple of shrimp, a mound of lettuce, mint leaves, and more pickled vegetables. It comes with a side bowl of Nuoc Mam. Spoon some over the whole dish, mix up, and it is a meal only a notch under my mom's level. Everyone is biased towards what we grow up with. My only complaint was that the meats were more on the salty side. My friend took a bite of it and said that he might forgo getting the Pho Dac Biet ( Regular $6.95) one day and order this instead. That in itself is an amazing feat, because he will spend a whole day hanging out at the house when my dad makes Pho and eat 4 bowls before the day end.\nWe also got a Banh Mi Thit Nuong to go for a friend. The meat came in a generous portion. It kept it's warm and tenderness for quite some time. The lean meat and filling were good, but the bread needs more of a crunch. It was too doughy for my taste. It is more expensive than most places costing around $5, but the meat alone is worth it."

We could have easily just walked in without paying because when we went up to the ticket window no one was there...but we pondered too long and a lady finally showed up to rob us of our money.\nThe zoo was full of pigeons and chickens just running around free and wild...which wouldn't matter that much if they were not missing half their feathers and looked sad and diseased...it was gross and depressing.

    "text": "Let me start out by saying that I purchased a VIP package through the Cosmo: $4K for 2 nights in a wrap-around suite overlooking the Florence & the Machine concert, 8 add'l concert tickets, & a Steamer Trunk. We got one add'l day @ $350. This was for my husband's 30th and I wanted everything to be perfect.\nI had many email conversations with Kendall in the VIP dept, who was super helpful. At one point, the Cosmo double-charged my card, and she was able to get everything straightened out, although it took about 2 weeks. I asked her about cabana reservations too late, and we couldn't get one at the Blvd pool for $750, so I settled for one at the Bamboo pool for $1K. The day before we got there, I got a call from Shelly confirming my reservation, who was also very helpful. She informed me we would have a direct VIP contact when we checked in that could help with whatever we needed during our stay, but that her & Kendall would also be available if anything went wrong. I told her my friend would be checking in early and setting up our room. Shelly said everything would be ready by 10 so my friend could arrive any time after that and everything would be fine. She suggested that the Steamer Trunk be delivered before we checked in for the \"wow\" factor. I went with it.\nThen we arrive in Las Vegas...\nI call my friend to see how the room is. She arrived at 12 &still had not been let into the room by 2:30. The VIP concierge kept saying the room wasn't ready, and then ended up giving us a room that was not our room. It was several floors higher &barely had a view of the concert. The Steamer Trunk was not delivered before we arrived. Not only were we pissed about having to wait for the room, we also did not have any booze to drink.\nI called my so-called go-to people, Kendall and Shelly, and neither answered, nor did I ever get a call back. I ended up speaking with David, who understood why'd I would be so pissed off, and promised me the trunk would be send \"right up.\" Haha, \"right up,\" you don't know how many times I heard those words this weekend? He informed me that the concert tickets, which I had expected to be in the room, would be available at will call the night of the concert and told me he could be my direct contact during my stay. About AN HOUR AND A HALF, the Steamer Trunk was delivered, minus a bottle of champagne. I guess they thought we weren't celebrating?!?\nLater that evening, I get a call confirming my reservation at the Bvd pool and the woman informed me that the pool would be drained because of the concert. #1) my reservation was at the Bamboo pool. #2) why are they selling cabanas at a pool with no water?\nSat. morning, I call the front desk because we have a cabana reservation @ 9 but the pool opens @ 8. They inform me that the 9 time was incorrect, and that the pools now open @ 8. I get down there right at 8 to make sure we get the cabana and a few chairs near the pool. The guy, who must have been LOADED, just kind of stood there when I told him we had a cabana reservation, like he couldn't understand what I was saying. Then another guy at the stand tells me I can come back in 15 minutes & he'll let me know which cabana is ours. I come back in 15 minutes, then in 25, 35, 45, 55... Finally @ 9:15 they let me have my cabana and tell me a waitress would be \"right out.\" @ 10:30 the waitress comes by. We had about 6 different waiters/waitresses the 6 or so hours we were at the pool. Nobody knew how to turn the fan on, the TV didn't work, and it took on average 45 minutes for your drinks to arrive & an hour 15 minutes for food to come.\nWe leave the Cosmo for dinner/drinks and I call and request housekeeping to come up and clean the room. We were gone for about 4 hours and when we came back, lo & behold the room was exactly as we left it.\nWe were running a little bit late so we started watching some of the concert from our room, even though it was too high up to see anything. During a song we weren't huge fans of, we head down to the concert on fl. 4. Only you can't get off on fl. 4! Did I mention I spent $4,000 to have this room because of the concert? We never found will call because we couldn't even get to the floor to get to will call. We went back up to the room and finished watching the show completely angry by this point because of the waste of money.\nSunday morning most of our party left and my hubby and I wanted some alone time. We left the room @ 10 and put the \"Please Clean\" sign on the door. We got back to the room @ 2 and the room hadn't been clean. By this point it was almost comical. We left the sign up and started taking showers. Housekeeping ended up coming @ 5:30, while I was in the shower, so they wouldn't even clean.\nNeedless to say, I will NEVER stay at the Cosmo ever again. Worst service EVER! Even if you get a VIP package, do not expect any type of service. I've stayed at 2 star resorts with better service!"

He gave us a smoking floor room when my wife has bad asthma and I had requested a non smoking room.

I cant think of many restaurants I feel this way about. Good luck to the Mishima family wherever you are now.\nbelow is my original review from 2006:\nThis is my favorite DL (downlow) Sushi restaurant when I visit the Phoenix area. I have very special reasons for this... The restaurant is owned by a Japanese couple that run the whole restaurant themselves. The husband prepares the food, while the wife waits on the tables. It is a real labor of love! I always enjoy restaurants where they remember me personally and treat me like family. This is one of those places! The menu is almost limitless, Mishima San (Mr. Mishima) is trained in all culinary areas and make you almost anything you want (food stock providing). The Ox tail is particularly good, as is the Unagi Don (grilled eel over rice). Don't forget to try the Sashimi, if travelling in a group- get an excellent deal on the Sushi boat. Most Japanese beers are in stock, so I usually choose Orion from Okinawa(light full bodied flavor). It is usually the hardest beer to find at Japanese restaurants. This is a small Izakiya style restaurant that has a family atmosphere, and the bathroom is clean!. Anything it lacks is well made up for with flavor and old world style Japanese hospitality. Oishkata!!! (delicious)... Enjoy:)"

I can understand that they MAY be AKC registered (which looking at the paperwork is hard to believe.) and that makes them more valuable but let's be honest, these are animals from a PET STORE. Not a reputable breeder or a shelter. You can get a true AKC registered pet from a breeder for HALF the cost and with higher care of the animal. \nI give kudos to this place for making people sanitize their hands before touching the animals (unlike Pet Pros) however I did see them giving some of their puppies PINK water, which causes suspicion to the health of these animals. Usually when Pet Stores give animals water with \"medicine\" in it, it is so that they will pass the initial vet exam...(keep them healthy until their out of our care then who care's if they die). It's unfortunate but true. \nIf you are going to purchase an animal from here and not go through a reputable breeder or adopt from a shelter, proceed with caution. Like a wise man once told me; \"Expect the worst, hope for the best."

Yes - it was still dark out when I left the house. It was extremely difficult to get up and go (I used to be an early morning person when I worked an office job, but not anymore) - but I'm so glad I did...\nIt was my second time at this location - it's in the same center as LA Fitness at McCormick Parkway & Hayden. Years ago, I went to Sumit's Frank Lloyd Wright Location and the Tatum / Shea one before it closed. If you like to sweat, Sumits is for you...\nIn case you're not familiar, Sumits Yoga was created by Sumit Banerjee based on his own years of experience practicing and teaching various yoga styles. The classes follow the same sequence of poses (similar to Bikram) but they flow to music... and since the room is heated, your muscles warm up quickly and allow you to work deeply.\nIt felt great to sweat it out this morning - I think Sumit's Yoga is an excellent compliment to my exercise routine, and for that reason I bought a 5 class package ($75). Whether I return to an early morning class or at another time of day, I look forward to 'sweating it out' again soon!"

The resort is off the strip, way off. However, if you do find the time to drive about 10 miles down Las Vegas Blvd, you will see the most beautiful blue building literally in the middle of nowhere. When you go inside the building, go up the escalators, past the lobby filled with the beautiful white tulips, down the endless rows of casino tables and slot machines and you will finally see it. The Studio B buffet. OMG.\nHands down, most variety of food I've seen in any Vegas buffet (including Rio and Paris), and best tasting overall. They've got sushi, chinese food, thai food, italian food, the largest variety of salads of any buffet AND an open bar. HELL YEA! Did I mention that their dessert section has a full service gelato stand? HELL YEA!\nThe prices of this beautiful man-made heaven goes like this: you'll find the cheapest prices for lunch on a WEEKDAY only. On weekends it is only brunch, which is about $25 I believe. Dinner is about $32 and that includes the seafood buffet (seafood buffet = crab legs, shrimp, and oysters). I don't really care to spend my time and energy cracking those crab legs, plus I don't really care for oysters, so the lunch buffet is good enough for me! \nBTW, it can get REALLY crowded around 7 or 8 for dinner, so try to come earlier like around 5 or 6. The wait can get REALLY long (once it was about 45 minutes!)\nYou can bet your bootie that I will be back here! HELL YEA!"

    "text": "First I would like to say that I love Gordon Ramsay, and I mean with a deep abiding love. Please take that as a warning that this review may be slanted. But not really because this restaurant is so awesome, so beautiful, so everything, that if you don't make this a stop on your trip through Sin City, then you have just missed the best restaurant you're going to find here.\nIf it isn't apparent, I'm a huge fan of steak restaurants. I love them like I love GR. So how perfect is it that he gave us this glorious restaurant for our very own? I KNOW.\nLet me begin by saying that if you want to know what great service is, start here. I'm pretty sure GR put the fear of death into these servers because they don't miss a beat. You ask for nothing, you send nothing back. Why? Because the amazing thing about this restaurant is just how perfect everything is. \nWalked in and as you're being escorted to your seat the hostess who is genuinely kind and informative, she points out some really nice touches. I'll let you find out what those are . She leads you through this tunnel-like entrance into the most beautiful restaurant; it gleams. It has this amazing staircase on either side of the restaurant. We were seated upstairs in the middle of this. It was the perfect location. Also, everyone is beautiful here. I'm pretty sure that wasn't planned, but thank you anyway. \nAs we sit down, we're greeted IMMEDIATELY by our waiter. I'm not going to be redundant so I'll just say that everything that happened, happened IMMEDIATELY. Ordered drinks, perfection. Bread selection, perfection (and so, so delicious, soft bread, imported English butter, ugh, I'm fat now), VERY cool drink menu that you look at on an iPad (and clever!), dinner menus, tasting menus, so much to choose from, it's like an adult candy store, except replace the candy with meat. \nI had the 24 oz. bone-in ribeye with a side of foie gras (yikes - addictive). It was a large cut of meat so I didn't finish TODAY, but don't worry, it WILL be finished. It was perfectly seared on the outside and warm and red on the inside. It had the perfect amount of marbling and was just the most tender steak I've had in this town. Just outstanding. As a side I had sauteed spinach - perfect, perfect, perfect, and asparagus with morels, white asparagus puree and a veal demi-glace - outrageously perfect. My date had the most perfect baked potato I've ever seen. It was huge, almost a meal by itself. It came with toppings that really were unique (smoked gouda béchamel? Oh god) and delicious. It's by far the best potato anywhere I've ever been.\nDessert. Oh my. I can't begin to describe what it did to my taste buds, but suffice it to say that the sticky toffee pudding cake had me melting into a puddle from the deliciousness. Try it, you'll love it. \nLet me end this by saying that I love Gordon...oh wait, no, what I wanted to say was that this restaurant is my brand new favorite. It really was an amazing experience that I can't wait to repeat! And soon!"

The sauce on the dipped chicken is somewhere between a buffalo style and bbq sauce. \nIt's definitely worth the trip, but if you are from Charlotte, I'd grab it to go."

There is plenty of accessible parking so I only have to feel lazy about driving to a bike trail, not frustrated that I can't even get there. The plaza areas are beautiful, with plenty of seating, art, and a choice of stairs or ramps so you never need to walk your ride. The pavement in still well kept and smooth. I love how the trail takes you under the routes to uptown and along the picturesque creek.\nMy one main issue is that the trail goes through a neighborhood right by Freedom Park and that detour is not so well marked. It would be wise to check out the Carolina Thread Trail map before embarking so you know where you are headed. If you do it right, the greenway takes you all the way from CPCC to just behind the Park Road Shopping Center (and back!) and gives you a great slice of nature in the process."

Then I discovered that we were among the handful of people who actually had to pay to get in, which was kind of a gut punch as cocktails are tremendously expensive.\nA very interesting stage show, some of the players interact with the audience, but the price point is very out of proportion to the actual performances.\nIf you're amongst the lucky majority that received a complimentary admission, go take a peek but I heavily suggest avoiding this place unless you smoke $90 cigars lit with $20 bills.\nThe performance art was entertaining and the interaction with the audience brought out a \"third dimension\" to the show. Think of well-dressed street performers, a little bit of \"Tap Dogs\", a little \"Blue Man Group\"-ish.\nI don't want to say it's a rip, but it's certainly priced for the Romanovs and not exactly worth the tremendous entry fee, especially when most of the club seemed as if they were there on comps.\nFeeling a little jaded and, well, financially leeched.\nIt's a stage show and then a standard night club. If you morphed the marquee with a sprinkle of cabaret and a very light touch of Cirque du Soleil, drop $300 for a couple, there you have rose rabbit lie."

It was early afternoon and the small restaurant was fairly empty, so we were attended to quickly. \nI got the Vegetable Tempura appetizer, which included broccoli (which I love), and mushrooms (which I despise), along with other veggies. I gave the mushrooms to the birthday girl, who also got the Spring Rolls appetizer. Both appetizers were good. The tempura was nice and light; not greasy or oily at all. And the portion was huge. \nSo, besides the appetizers, what's a vegan to eat at a sushi bar? Veggie rolls! \nThere's a Vegetarian Roll section on the Japanese menu. Mushi mushi! Arigato!\nMy vegan order:\nAVOCADO ROLL: \nstuffed with fresh avocado & rice, and wrapped in the naturally plant-based nori. (Does not have rice surrounding the outer parts of the roll.)\nTOFU SKIN & AVOCADO ROLL: \n1st of all, I didn't know that tofu had skin. Secondly, it's delicious! It's firm (not mushy) and the combination with avocado and the rice is very flavorful. The rice is on the outside of this roll. This is my favorite item here. \nThere were 8 pieces per roll.\nThey come with wasabi and ginger, which are both always fresh, and a yummy accompaniment to my veggie rolls. \n(Vegans who are sensitive to cross-contamination may want voice your concerns and make special requests. I did not see them switch up preparation areas or utensils. My food has never tasted \"fishy,\" but...just so you know.)\nDD loves the Crunchy Shrimp Tempura Roll & the Shrimp Avocado Roll. She also gets 8 pieces per roll.\nAll of our rolls were 50% off the regular menu price. I think this discount varies, based on which rolls you get.\nThey have other veg*n options, like Teriyaki Tofu & a veggie Udon noodle dish, which I'd love to try one day.\nWe now frequent Iron Chef, but we mostly do carry-out orders. We still get the 50% off though. There is a dedicated carry-out parking space located in front of their door, which is extremely helpful during peak times, when the parking lot is jam-packed. The employees are always very nice, and they package my veggie rolls separately from the meat rolls. They also give you a free drink with your to-go order, which is pretty sweet. \nThere's a patio dining area outside its front doors. The inside is dimly lit in the evenings; nice for a date night."

I readily admit to not having tried Cajun before so I'm hardly in a position to make authoritative comments or recommendations, comparing this place to other such restaurants.\nThere are two important things to know:\n1. Jambalaya, which was once only served on Mondays, is now served every night;\n2. If you're not a fan of fried or smoked foods, this may not be the place for you.\nWe started out with the fais do do combo appetizer platter. The onion rings, pickles and tomatoes were good, but all fried. If you're not used to fried foods or don't like deep fried dishes, you may want to think twice, as they were deep fried with light batter and were VERY greasy (so much so, that when I picked up my unsweetened tea in the mason jar, it almost slipped out of my hand). And although the pickles are full sours, combined with the fried batter, it was kind of salty.\nNow, to once again address the issue of salt, as I've done in other reviews: we NEVER use salt at home and have a much lower tolerance for salt than most people; so bear that in mind, when I tell you, that we found the jambalaya and gumbo to be pretty salty. Did I bother to ask them not to add salt, if that were possible? Of course not! So, I don't know whether that would've been possible; but at the very least, I can't complain about something I didn't bother asking about.\nPortions are large enough for the prices and the gumbo had a huge amount of meat in it; so don't think you're just getting a thick soup (actually, more watery than thick, but no shortage of meat here!).\nDecorations are sparse, so don't come here for the atmosphere. Service is fast and efficient. Personally, I can do without the \"Cajun\" music in the background. Sort of made me feel like I was having dinner on the set of Deliverance.\nIf you are a fan of Cajun food, I suspect you'll do very well here. If you're going to experiment like we did, just remember:\n1. Everything -- or practically everything -- is either fried or high in carbs;\n2. Drinking out of the mason jars may be \"cute\", but not easy at times;\n3. The salad that comes with dinner will leave you with the feeling, that, unless its fried, a vegetable is some fancy-shmancy foreign delicacy nowhere to be found in the Deep South;\n4. And if you're going to pick up an appetizer, DON'T -- I repeat: DON'T -- touch any of your clothes, unless you intended to throw them away the next day (if you insist, WD40 and baking soda will go a long way in removing those annoying grease stains).\nOverall, tasty, if not also salty; reasonably priced; different.; but not enough to make me go for a return visit. Sorry, just not my taste."

It amazes me how much time and effort they put into maintaining all the flowers and it's all free for the viewers! The atrium truly is gorgeous and I love all the little details they put into their over-the-top displays. I've seen most of their exhibits here and the Summer Garden Party and Chinese New Year displays are my favorite. I love the little greenhouse they have where there are butterflies flying around. \nDefinitely stop by if you make it over to Bellagio. It's truly a sight to behold!"

So when I show up during the week to have dinner it took 20 minutes to get water another 10 mins to get a server to realize we are even there and then another 15 mins to get drink. The food is decent and forget asking for refills because that takes another 10 mins. Plan on going on the weekends? Well I did and it took just as long to get a drink. Our waitress forgot about us and when she finally realized we ordered drinks she made another waitress serve us. So sad that a cool urban bar is just another waste of space"

Such a refresher from all the cookie cutter really over priced restaurants located inside the hotels!\nThe service was impeccable from the minute you walk in. The staff look like they stepped out of a Al Pacino move.. I mean that in a good way by the way...\nThe ambiance and the vibe were so up beat that just looking at their menu mad my mouth water. They make all their own pasta fresh, wow no Chef Ragu/Prego working there..\nWe ordered the antipasti appetizer. It was filled with different kinds of cheese, olives, pickled artichokes, prosciutto, spicy ham. I'm not a fan of olives but the red ones weren't all that bad. It was really good and pair that up with the bread they bring you at the table and you practically have your meal right there. But better save some room for your dinner because you have to try their pasta dishes. I ended up ordering the seafood spaghetti meal that had scallops, huge pieces of shrimp and calamari. I admit it was good but a little too much on the seafood. My BF had the Sea Bass and it was really melt in your mouth type of meal. The fish was cooked to perfection! \nI would have given them five stars but I wasn't that crazy about my meal but I am more than willing to go back for more and possibly change it.\nHighly suggest this restaurant when in Vegas. It's located behind the Hard Rock Hotel off of Paradise in shopping center that has CVS in it. \nOh and for the ladies.. in that shopping center is a nail salon that is open 24/7.. oh yeah.. I can see it now drunk mani/pedi's...good stuff.. Have to try that one when I go back to Vegas..."

    "text": "I went to Eat for the first time recently and enjoyed a great lunch. Excellent, Awesome, and Terrific, would be a good mnemonic device to remember this wonderful restaurant. Here are three reasons why I liked the place so much:\n1) The food was EXCELLENT! I had the Bánh Mì Sandwich with tofu and seasonal slaw on a baguette, served with a pickle spear and potato salad. The tofu was firm and slightly crispy, the slaw fresh and full of flavor, and the baguette soaked up the sandwich's delicious sauces without becoming soggy or mushy. I prefer a mustard-based potato salad, but the traditional one that came with my meal was a-ok. Tangent: I think it's cute that the menu describes the additional side as \"a really good pickle.\" Really! Overall, the meal filled me up without leaving me feeling bloated or gross--- perfect lunch portions! I ate every last bite!\n2) The staff was AWESOME. It appeared as though the owner and/or head chef was present, seated towards the side/back of the restaurant, close to where we were eating. (This might have been a contributing factor to the good service, but whatevs.) I always appreciate when owners/chefs are visibly present in the restaurant. To me, it speaks volumes and shows they actually care about their patrons, the food, and the community. Thanks for that!\n3) The restaurant looked TERRIFIC. It was exceptionally clean and also well decorated. I loved the variety of high tables and regular tables, make it perfect for groups, a business lunch, or a romantic meal. Side note: I went on a Friday at about 1:00 pm, and although I didn't have to wait for a table, the place was BUSY. I wouldn't be surprised if there are normally wait times, so plan ahead.\nEat was E-xcellent, A-wesome, and T-errific. A good name for a good restaurant! I'll definitely have to return for breakfast."

We have come to know and, ultimately, endure our frequent shopping trips with continually lowered expectations of anything positive coming our way. The checkout staff is, to a person, rude, unprofessional and often seem just really, really dumb. \nMy favorite story from Ghetto Target is a few months ago when I purchased some laundry detergent, paper towels and a birthday card. Upon my exit , a security guard followed me out of the store and asked to see my receipt for the purchase. Surprised, I replied kindly, \"no you can't but thanks for asking\". I kept walking to my car as the security guard \"ordered\" me to stop, threatening to call police. I calmly told him I was okay with his plan to call the cops, got in my car and drove away with him standing in my rear view mirror, looking like a complete idiot. \nOf course, it's Target, so I still go back. Often. Maybe I'll get a t-shirt that reads \"I survived Ghetto Target\"."

    "text": "This is now the second time we have been here, and both times we had great meals. After having been to many other high-end restaurants, I think this place offers incredibly good value as compared to some of the rest.\nSadly, I don't remember what I had the first time about a year ago, but I did remember having a very good meal. Last night's experience with the 4-course signature menu was very good. We did not choose the 7-course signature menu because the whole table would had have to have it.\nThe lineup was as follows:\nFois gras brûlée: very interesting concept and tasty. Basically creme brûlée made with fois gras. Worth trying once for the extra $10, but probably not worthwhile every time, as the Waygu beef tartar was also very good\nScallops: prepared well with ox tail\nPork loin - this is where the money was. After I took the first bite, I had to ask the waiter what I was eating because it was SO incredibly good. The loin itself was good, but they did a second part of it minced and seasoned with mostly pork shoulder, at least according to the waiter. It was unlike anything I have ever eaten. It would have been awesome if the whole dish was made out of that!!\nLayered chocolate cake with coffee ice cream: I remember using a different two-word term starting with a G (ganache?) but can't recall exactly, but wow it was heavenly. It appeared as a small bar, but it was densely rich an incredibly decadent. The coffee ice cream with cocoa shavings was also very good.\nOverall, a very good meal, and excellent value for the price. The Tea Rose cocktail was also very good. \nLast but not least, the ambiance was also well done. Our party of 8 was located in the smack middle of the filled dining room, yet we felt we can have private conversations without being overheard. We can tell it's very happening all around us, but we didn't have to talk loudly to be heard. \nI will definitely be back. It has become a favorite place of mine."

Admittedly, the setting is pretty scenic, but I kind of felt like I was in a suburban \"upscale\" mall restaurant that was trying to be more chic and happening than it could ever hope to be. \nI went with a Cobb Salad, which should have been a simple choice but the leaves seemed a bit wilted and the entire serving just a tad bland, even after a hefty dosing of pepper on my part. \nStill, service was relatively fast and friendly, so if I worked nearby, I can see how this could be an alright spot to keep on one's lunch circuit. No doubt about it, the best thing going here is the waterfront."

    "text": "There are many steakhouses in town, many options for cocktail hour, but this place has a few things going for it--frog legs and alligator. I figured that it was time to come back and try the food; like others before me, this place is a hit or miss, and this time it was a rollercoaster ride. \nWe started with the cajun grilled scallops over rice and fried alligator. White alligator meat isn't a problem, but the dark meat is a bit game-y. I ate it, but I didn't enjoy it as I should have. The scallops were definitely blackened and good with the sausage they skewered together.\nThe main course was a Snake River Farms NY Sirloin that the server said was wagyu-like. I am going to assume he meant American wagyu because the meal was only $39 and included blue lump crab meat. Anyway, the steak was pretty tough for a Snake River Farms cut but it was well seasoned, no doubt. The crab meat was nice, and I never ordered an oscar-style steak before. That being my first time topping a steak with anything, it was okay, but I didn't enjoy it as I should have. The side of mashed potatoes and the veggies were just as big as the steak. Needless to say, they really should cut the side dish portions down. It was a waste.\nDessert was skipped because the food portions were huge as it was. Overall, for $156 bucks it was okay, but I wouldn't come back again. The service was interesting; he was a nice guy, but the rush to leave the table after our order or after checking on us felt just a tad like we were imposing on his time. I still tipped him reasonably well because he kept the water topped off.\nThere's just one thing I'm worried about--the air fresheners. I cannot begin to explain the overwhelming scents of Febreeze in this restaurant. It's to the point where I swore something rotted and they were masking it, or the carpet is musty and they're masking that. I just don't like seeing Febreeze spray bottles in my hostess's hands when we walk in and those standalone units above a few booths. Scary to me.\nIf you believe my opinion counts, then here it is: don't go there unless it's one of those \"we need to try every restaurant in Vegas at least once\" kind of moments. Portions are a good size, but the overall experience is lackluster."

Anyway, it was pretty tasty and of a decent size. I'm not sure I like a mound of guacamole and full size tortilla chips (not strips) in my salad, but it was good nonetheless. I would like to return to try their tacos.\nTheir chips were good and fresh but their 4 or so salsas were just ok. None really stood out to me in terms of flavor or heat.\nThe only thing that really stood out about this place was the service.

She ended up with what the doctors thought was fatty liver disease and simply had no interest in food, treats, tuna fish, or water. My husband and I tried for over a day to syringe feed/water her and she was simply weak and miserable and we were heartbroken doing that to her. She was a class act girl and upon waking up today, she seemed just to live for me. I couldn't be that selfish nor would I put her through the trauma of yet another car ride. I went online to search and Happy Endings was the first thing that came up. I watched the testimonial, loved how informative the website was and called. I left a message and Alicia called me back within 20 minutes and I was lucky enough that they could help us today. Dr. Fixler and his assistant were very kind and knowledgeable and didn't rush us with the time we needed with our girl. Don't get me wrong, it's still as painful as can be, but in the comfort of our home without the dreaded drive was worth every penny and then some.

To say that they will raised the bar even on the second time dining, is quite impressive!\nEntering Mastro's you are taken immediately to your table (reservations strongly recommended, especially if celebrating a particular occasion). There is a bar area off to the left side, with ample seating, then to your right the general dining room area. A private dining room is available for groups.\nYour waiter or waitress promptly arrives at your table to welcome you ever so warmly to Mastro's. Warm conversation is most certainly to be had, and most of all, it's sincere. Mastro's really made us feel like royalty (even with many people around us sharing the same dining experience), and conversation was earnest with our waiter and friendly.\nMastro's boasts a variety seafood and steak dishes. The highlight of this particular Mastro's being seafood; one cannot go wrong with their ever well stocked Mastro's Seafood Tower. This tower is truly amazing! It can be tailored for the amount of people in your group, and can include a variety of fresh seafood appetizers of your choosing. Of particular deliciousness, are their crab and their jumbo shrimp cocktail. Chilled to perfection, each bite is a seafood lover's dream.\nFor the main course, the 12 oz fillet is of most generous portion. Any steakhouse in the area would be rivaled to Mastro's generous portion and taste. Each bite (even with my being well-done) was juicy and flavorful. Be sure to pair your steak with a vegetable and starch, which rounds out your meal perfectly. Their steamed spinach is light, yet full of flavor. The lobster macaroni and cheese is full of rich and creamy cheese, and portions of lobster meat mixed in. This dish is extremely filling, but a unique experience for any macaroni and cheese lover.\nTo round out the evening, one cannot forget about their decadent desserts. For this particular evening, their Signature Warm Butter Cake was a delivery from heaven! This dessert is full of buttery and soft cake tastiness inside, along with a heaping scoop of vanilla ice cream to balance out the warm cake.\nI look forward to my next trip to Mastro's Ocean Club. Mastro's will truly pull out all of the stops to make your evening the most enjoyable in their surroundings and unforgettable dishes. Check out Mastro's Ocean Club for your most special of occasions. Mastro's locations can be found in Arizona, California, Nevada and Illinois."

I also had one girl ask me if I needed help with finding anything so I said \"I am looking for a 80's outfit for a party\"....All I got was a \"Oh\" and she walked off and greeted another customer...WTF?

Most crawfish joints do kind of the same thing but the variations in the sauces make them different. What sets this place apart is they use the sichuan pepper (i think) which leaves your mouth a little numb but taste great and creates a unique spiciness. As far as the items to order Ive had most of the menu but here are my suggestions.\nKing Crab Legs - Hands down the item to get. Huge chunks of crab with little effort. You just have to know how to use the little plastic claw tool. Use one side to make a crack then the other to slice through like scissors through paper. Ask your server if you need help. Don't be afraid of the price these are well worth it, trust me you wont be sorry. \nShrimp - If your not going big with the crab legs then these are the best bang for your buck. Best meat to price ratio and easy to eat.\nCorn - Soaks up the sauce like a sponge. Make room in your gut for this. Don't Sleep! \nFries - Regular or Sweet Potato are both tasty and good sharing choices to break up all the buttery spice from the seafood.\nSauce - I prefer the everything mix or whatever they call it here. I also prefer extra spicy which I wouldn't suggest for most people. Even spicy has a kick to it.\nThey can handle large groups and there is a second one down the street if this one is full."

    "text": "Following one of my favorite Yelpers review (shout out to Philly T!) I stepped in for a quick bite the day we had a sitter for the evening. Starved from luxurious cuisine for about a month I could not have been more excited to find Japaneiro to be the perfect amount of silver spoon in a strip mall. The chefs are as magical as unicorns. To find this caliber of skill in each plate offered at the most nominal of ranges is evident that the owners are either well trained chefs who love what they do, or are quite too humble for their own good. \nJapanese-French fusion has been happening for quite some time. Japaneiro takes this genre of cuisine much more seriously. Sure one could state that the location isn't quite Las Vegas Blvd. Then again if you are that type of person, you still are only 7 or so miles away if you need something fancy to look at. I based this review mainly on the dishes served. Also upon entrance we were greeted warmly by the staff and chef was also very welcoming throughout. There is not a lot of seating by normal standards. Which just makes things more intimate.\n\"The Board\" was our menu that day. We started with the Bone Marrow with Truffle Butter & wonton chips. This was a most filling and decadent bone. It could not have been more rich or warming for the season. I found the broiled gelatinous goodness to be expertly timed and not losing much of it's substance or flavor as I've tried elsewhere. The truffle flavor incorporates subtly with the entire entree and the light crisp of the wonton was a perfect binder. 5/5\nSeared Scallops with Uni. How could I explain this differently from the other times I have tried this combination? Well, this time it was done right. Large sweet snappy scallop subdued and surrendering oceanic sweet uni flavor deeper into each bite. The warmth of the slightly seared scallop combined with a cool seaweed salad spoonful underneath it all. Okay. That basically explains it. Next time I'm ordering 4 of these to myself. 5/5\nUni Chawamushi with Ikura. A new adventure for me! Strange are the ways that the honorable sea urchin has been mixed into cuisine. This was certainly a change of pace for my Uni addiction. Dig into the custard and divulge some uni and a few pops of roe on to your spoon. The softness of custard gives uni a place to mingle and the salty Ikura contrasts the situation. I need to study this Chawamushi dish further before I can give a premature rating. I do know I love uni and ikura thats for sure!\nNow for the Foie Gras. I wish I could remember what exactly was in those sauces! I really do because I am known to keep Foie stocked in my house and every month or so I have a break from my seafood diet and sear up a slice. I realize that there is no way I could possibly replicate Japaneiro's version, yet still. A thick sauce of a very umami tart miso-like consistency was cooked on top and a light and bright sauce was set aside that had a hint of acidity. Appropriate. 5/5\nNy Steak with mustard and truffle sauce. Ny is a perfect cut for medium rare. I don't have beef very often but I had to try this. Tender pre cut and organised beautifully. Take a slice and dab onto the mustard then dip it into the truffle buttered sauce and take a bite. Devoured this lovely slab of beef in record time. 5/5\nDon't be put off by what surrounds the table. Take a bite and close your eyes. These plates hold exquisite quality and the value is the only thing at a premium. You see my star rating. I will be watching Japaneiro very closely."

You know it is a popular brunch place, and of course in a good location as well. However, as the services were pretty slow for both times and the food did not 'wow' me at neither times, I just have to give an average ratings... \nWhat I like on both tries? The orange juice! Yes, it was fresh and delicious! The Prime Rib omelette was pretty good as well, especially if you add a few drops of Tabasco for a spicy hint, it just tasted better! However, what I did not like, the Smoked Salmon Egg Benedict... The dish arrived kinda cold, feels like it was sitting on the counter longer that it should have, the english muffin was over-toasted which it became hard to cut, the poached eggs were not done so well (i think they were too flat by the shape?), and there was too much of the Hollandaise sauce on the top and it just stole the taste of the smoked salmon... how I wish it was better.\nIf you are in the area and look for a place for breakfast/brunch, Daily Dose is still a good choice, just be prepared for a wait on the weekend and avoid the Egg Benedict?"

When someone commented on the wait for the drinks, she made them feel as if it was our fault. Rude, unprofessional, burgers poorly cooked. Far too long a wait, and the price too high.

I heard about this place as a decent dive in town, and it was just down the lot from me. \nI walked in and saw what looked like a pretty decent place. It was a slow night for a weekend, so I went to the bar and stationed a bar stool. The bartender did the usual \"Hi, what can I get you.\" \nI had a country fried steak and a beer. For 12 dollars, it was a decent meal, and I was happy I ordered it. Cheap eats and decent booze..\nA weekend later I came back. This time there was two bartenders and the bar was full, so I took a seat at one of the booths. I sat for about ten minutes waiting. One of the kitchen guys saw that I hadn't been helped and showed up with a menu and asked me what I wanted to drink. \nI was thankful he helped me. I ordered a water and a kiltlifter, a Phoenix microbrew. He told the bartender that had ignored me up until that point that I was indeed there and had intent to be a paying customer. She showed up with my Kiltlifter and asked if I wanted to eat something, of which I did order the country fried steak off the night menu again. I reminded her I wanted a water too. \nSo I get my food. Still no water. I ask for it again. She said sure. Ate my food, then got my tab. Still no water.\nFirst experience: Good. Second experience: Not so good.\nI would recommend this place for a good bite to eat, but don't expect to be able to rehydrate here... I've heard it's a good place when it's hopping, but I didn't see any eye candy while I was there. It's a decent neighborhood dive, but definitely not a place I'd expect stellar service, although some of the staff seems well trained, once they pass you on, you may want to flip a coin."

That should suffice to date me. \nIt was a thrilling big new mall in 1982-83.

I called several larger plumbing services, and a few other contractors, but Artie was the one we selected. \nI called him, he came over that afternoon, and gave us a free estimate. His estimate wasn't over the top, and was quite a bit better than another competitor. As soon as he showed up at the house, you could tell he was a professional. He put shoe covers on before he came in the house. He talked me through what we needed to do, and he got it done. He is the type of plumber you want to work with. There are so many \"shady\" people out there, it's nice to know people care about their customers. Artie does. \nThere is no doubt in my mind. If we ever have any other plumbing issues, I'll be calling Artie. He's our go to guy. I would highly recommend him to anyone!!"

The front entrance of the club looked like a bit of a mess, there were multiple lines and groups of people all over the place. We had bottle service set up and it seemed like the door guys were a bit of douche bags - a bit too high and mighty with that clip board. No need to be a dick!\nWe had bottle service in the \"hip hop\" room - which I swear to god was more like a hallway. \nNow the DJ in this room was Amazeballs - played all the hits and had my ass shaking all night long! He was super nice, willing to take requests (even though he really didn't need any) and was actually from the Bay - where one of my girls is from. Super cool dude.\nI can't say anything really negative about the music in the hip hop room. The main room is house (oontz oontz oontz) and just so not my thing - so I never really went out there. But the Hip Hop room itself is super small, just one strip on the side of the club. We were honestly the only people with bottle service in there so it didn't seem like something you really needed to get a bottle for. I don't recall that many other people really dancing - but i was pretty wasted.\nThe hostess and security was on point and really nice. Anytime some dude came around was getting to \"handsy\" or pushy they quickly got him the hell out of there which was really comforting. Like most clubs in Vegas, water doesn't come free here. Its $9 a bottle and if you don't want a hangover,, you will be spending a ton on water. Unless your like me and my bestie - when a guy comes up to you and asks to buy you a drink, just ask for a bottle of water :)\nOverall - it would be nicer if they gave free water, if the Hip Hop room was larger in size and maybe if the main room had a little variety in the music they played. Oh and get less douchebag door guys."

    "text": "My favorite brunch in Vegas. This place is so, so, so good in so many different ways.\nFirst, a brief word about how the brunch works. It's a hybrid of buffet service and a la carte, which usually means either/or. In this case, it means AND. As a proud glutton, I'm a big fan of \"and.\" You can order whatever you like from the kitchen, and while they're making your dishes, you can graze from the many - god I hate this phrase - \"action stations\" where chefs whip up smoothies, sandwiches, sushi and more. The meal is $40 or so per person.\nThe best things to get from the buffet stations include ham and fontina on pretzel bread or the pecorino honeycomb panini. Especially the latter - the combination of sweet and savory here is amazing. From the sushi station, the crispy rice and tuna is craveworthy and delicious.\nBut don't fill up without getting an entree or two from the kitchen. Best of the bunch is the French toast, made of a melt-in-your-mouth brioche dredged in Frosted Flakes. Skip the syrup, this doesn't need it.\nThe Margherita pizza is decent - it's not VPN, of course, but it's quite tasty. The lobster benedict also and the banana Nutella crepes also got rave reviews from my companions.\nThe meal concludes with the infamous SImon junk food platter, which features Kerry Simon's versions of things like the Hostess cupcake, Rice Krispie Treats, chocolate chip cookies, brownies and even a pile of cotton candy. Save room.\nDrink service: they offer a $17 add-on option for bottomless Bellinis or Bloody Marys, the latter of which you can customize to your liking with dozens of veggies, hot sauces, condiments and add-ons all the way up to Slim Jims.\nThe atmosphere is great. The casual vibe is enhanced by the staff in pajamas, and sometimes the guests as well. Kerry Simon has been in the kitchen every time I've eaten here, and Palms founder George Maloof is regularly in the front of the house.\nBy far the best reason to get out of bed before noon on a Saturday. Or after - they serve until 4pm."

Is there?\nThis is one of the high roller places in Scottsdale. I saw a guy take a wad of Benjis out of his pocket that seriously made me consider rolling him. But my boss might have objected. Damn boss.\nIt's all about service and steak here. And I'm down with that. We had crab legs for an appetizer. Quite nice for a land-locked state. Fresh and tasty. A tomato salad with sharp onion that I enjoyed. And shared a porterhouse the size of my... yes. My ass. If one could give a nice slap to a porterhouse, this would be quite a spankable piece of meat. I love the way you can hear your steak coming to your table in all it's sizzling glory. The first thing to hit your nose is the lovely perfume of the butter. Chanel # Yum. Then that aroma of the meat. \nI know we had a couple of sides. But I honestly can't remember because the steak was so freaking perfect. To a corn-fed born and bred midwestern girl this is perfection. \nThe service is near perfect too. Our waitress gave us a wine selection for the steak that was spot on. Not too tanic. Not too tame. Held up nicely against the butter and the porterhouse. At the end of the meal I was I nearly unable to move. And that says a whole lot. I've been known to out eat grown men without batting an eye. \nOh, and if you don't like butter on your steak? Three words. \"Hold the butter.\" May save you some pain."

    "text": "I try to stay at the Wynn whenever I go to Vegas. Hotels that I have visited: Stratosphere, Mandalay Bay, The Venetian, Bellagio, Caesar's Palace, Treasure Island, Encore, and Wynn. Out of those places, my favorite is the Wynn for their excellent FAST service, decor, restaurants, casino floor, and staff. I was comped three nights there with a $150.00 resort credit, the best thing ever! \nRooms:\nI actually prefer Wynn's suites over Encore, to me it's just more simpler and serene. Encore is more for groups, there's a living area, so your friends can stop by and hang out with you. Att the Wynn, when I first walk into the foyer I feel like as if I am at home and I can jump into bed and look out the window at the beautiful strip. If you get a chance to, you have to order room service for dinner and just take in everything and relax, then go party and gamble afterwards :-) I absolutely love their bathrooms! The toilet is its own room which is a plus! I love the shower head, it's like washing yourself underneath a waterfall :-). The bedding and bed are so comfortable; you'd feel like you're sleeping on air. \nRestaurants:\nThe Buffet! Is my second favorite from RIO's seafood buffet. Wynn's buffet used to be my favorite, but since they had taken away their flan, I stopped going.\nThere is a chinese restaurant at Encore, it's called Wasusu? I loved it! I love the decor from the big booths, to how it is open so when you're eating you can also keep your eyes open to what's happening on the casino floor. I would come here for lunch again.\nThe Spa:\nTheir spa is heaven! I absolutely loved The Wynn's spa and I will definitely be coming there again. If you do go, please make sure to arrive there at least 2 hours in advance so that you can take advantage of their spa amenities and then have your service. Right when the elevator opens, you'll notice the difference in ambiance and their reception area is so welcoming. I like to lounge around there for a few minutes and just relax while waiting for a friend. Make sure to drink their teas and have some fruits :-). My only regret was that I did not use the amenities enough last time I went, I had booked my appointment right away and didn't have time to enjoy the rest. Ooo ladies, this is European style, but you can also wear a bathing suit of course. I prefer going Euro ;-). \nThe Wynn Theatre:\nI'm very picky with my theatres and where I see my shows or concerts. I hate The Staples Center or the Honda Center in California because the layout is NOT for concerts, sound just floats everywhere and you can't hear anything! ugghhh pet peeve.... Wynn's Theatre is not like that, you have the stage and the audience fans out, like how a theatre is suppose to be. Their sound system is amazing, I saw Le Reve here and I absolutely loved it. Such a different experience and no matter where you sit, the performers are not tiny, where you'd like binoculars. Granted, I have seen all the Circus Du Soleil show, my favorite is \"O\", absolutely amazing! The reason is, I love to swim and their show is just wonderful in the water. Any Circus Du Soleil show would be great to see, just depends on your budget.\nGolf Course:\nPlease please please, go visit the golf course! It is awesome!!!\nI think that covers it! Let me know if you guys have questions and I'll try to answer! ooo and my luck at the Wynn on the penny machine won me $500.00, so that was a bonus!"

Instead of reminiscing about my childhood, let's make time to evaluate a ridiculously long list of martinis, many with inappropriate names. \nTherapy has gone through some changes over the past year or two, morphing from a small martini bar to a larger scale \"marketplace and cafe\" that still offers live music and an enormous martini menu. I have to think that they're trying to be everything to everyone at this point, as they now offer breakfast, lunch and dinner. Odd, but I won't knock it until I try it. It's been ages since I popped by Therapy for a meal, so I can only fairly evaluate their libations.\nI copied their drink special from their website...here they are:\nmon: Bartender Selection $2\ntues: $2 domestics & $3 microbrews\nwed: award winning 1/2 price martini night\nthurs: $5 house flavored margarita martinis\nfri: select 1/2 price glasses & bottles of wine\nlive music, no cover\nsat: live music, no cover\nI'm a fan of their half price martini Wednesdays, as they conjure up some super creative beverages. The regular martini price is $12, so for $6 you get a sizeable martini made by some talented bartenders. A few of my favorites are: You've Got Some Balls, Narcissus Nectar and the Chocolate Adonis (a dessert in a glass). I recommend getting here early if you're going to partake in the half price martinis, as it can get a bit crowded. And as Faith D. noted - they validate parking in the connecting garage, hooray!\nHappy & safe consumption!"

When we first walked in another couple had walked in at the same time. They looked around and tryed to talk to the guy standing behind the counter and just ended up leaving. While we were looking to see what flavors were available there were no other customers in the establishment and they did not close for another hour. Yet the guy working did nothing but stand behind the counter and play with his cell phone. Every time we would ask him a question it was like we were bothering him to do his job. A few of the yogurts must have been out but when trying a machine he never would acknowledge that it was out or if he was making more. The were no waffle cones for the cups and when we mentioned those again he was too preoccupied by his cell phone. Toppings were also running low or completely empty.\nAll the other Menchie's we have gone to we have always had great customer service but I felt like the employee was ready to close the store already and just waiting for the night to end instead of helping out customers."

    "text": "On my annual roadtrip to Vegas with my family (yeah I'm classy like that) we almost always go straight to Ellis Island for dinner. Originally we went for $6 steak dinner (not on the menu) and $1 draft beer. Since then, prices have raised- beers are now $2/pint at the bar, and $2.50 at the table. I in no way believe that's expensive, just pointing it out. Also- the steak special is now $12, unless you have a coupon, which you can only get if you have a player's card. With the coupon it's $9 or so. So keep that in mind when you come. \nHonestly the steak is pretty good but on our last trip, we ate here two times and I got different items instead. Once I got the chicken and rice pilaf, I can't remember the exact name. It was excellent- sauteed chicken breast, spinach, sundried tomatoes, and mushrooms on top of pilaf. It also came with salad. The next time I got \"no carb fried chicken\" which is just fried chicken without breading, and I will say that this made me rethink fried chicken completely. It was without a doubt much better than most fried chicken I've ever had, specifically because the skin was able to get very crispy not being battered, and the meat was incredibly moist and flavorful due to the skin being on. \nWe've definitely had some colorful visits here, and sometimes the food has been not as good. The steak can be chewy and tough at times, and once my father literally choked on it (like, there was a line of people giving him the Heimlich maneuver). However I think he blames it on his lack of chewing, not the food, since he happily returns here for the steak. I realize that's a bizarre endorsement but hey, it's gotta count for something. Our most recent visit, it was right after my birthday and right before my mother's birthday and our waiter brought us a free slice of their chocolate cake. Normally I wouldn't care much about free chocolate cake, but this was fantastic. It was also made in house and really made me see their desserts in a different light. The BBQ, pizza and deli options here are also very good, so I would happily come back here on my next trip, and if you want a good cheap meal, I would recommend others come here as well."

A couple left to get some food and arrived back in about 20 minutes ... but their plane had left. The rule is that even if we post a delay your flight might leave R Amy time without you .... So, if the airline is late they can fool you I to leaving and then take off without you WTH again?"

It's pastrami or corned beef with cole slaw and kraut on a bread of your choosing. \nEveryday they have a daily special. Tuesdays are a good day as the specials are turkey with all the trimmings or meatloaf. The meatloaf is very tasty. The last time I ordered it I thought the mashed potatoes that came with it were a bit too whippped up. I like my potatoes slightly lumpy.\nThis place is usually packed around lunch time, so beware as the lines can be long, but usually go fast.\n I have been here for breakfast and dinner and those are the less busy times. It can almost be a ghost town around those times.\nI recommened breakfast here as it's very good and affordable. Where I think their prices for lunch and dinner are a bit much, breakfast is pretty cheap and you get a decent amount of food."

    "text": "I love reading about my yelp friends' vacation finds. I always bookmark them because although I never know when I'll be in that part of the country, I do know those bookmarks will eventually become tourist destinations for me. My yelp bud Tim S. knows his comfort foods. When he raves about a pizza in New York, a cheesesteak in Philly, or a hot dog in Phoenix, I'm so there. Wait a Hot Dog in Phoenix? That can't be right. This ain't Chicago or New York. Or is it? Ted's is a Buffalo, NY Hot Dog blooming right here in the middle of the desert, transplanted in 1983 from it's 1927 original wintery environment. \nSometimes when you are a food tourist, it's ok to over order and try a few different things. It's not ok for your waistline, but \"Hey you're on vacation!\" At least that's what I tell myself. And I got absolutely no judgement from Ted's when I ordered a Regular Hot Dog, a Jumbo All Beef dog, an Italian Sausage, and a Bratwurst. Chased down with some Onion Rings and a Loganberry Milkshake.\nSo what makes Ted's so good, is the charcoal. As I came in, they were adding a bunch of new charcoal to the grill. It gives the dog a nice smokey flavor and a good snap. Each of my 4 dogs/ sausages were excellent and it's tough to choose which one was best. I actually think I preferred the basic hot dog, because of the soft grind of the wiener offset with the crunchy slightly charred casing. It was texture heaven for sure, and I got this one dressed in classic Chicago style - chopped onions, relish, tomato, pickle, and yellow mustard. I dressed the all beef with kraut and chopped onions - excellent dog although a little firmer in texture, as most beef dogs are. \nThey have polish, bratwurst, italian, and a white hot under their sausage menu. I read a couple of slightly negative reviews on the white hot, so while it sounded very interesting, I had no room to put one down on this visit. Italian and Bratwurst it was for me and I got them dressed the same way with grilled onions and peppers. I opted for the hot sauce on the side. The hot sauce pairs perfectly with the Italian Sausage. This is a nice and spicy Italian. Adding the hot sauce seemed to just reinforce that same flavor, rather than cover it up. Ted's has an interesting home made hot sauce. If you made a salsa out of hot dog condiments, this is what you would get - relish, onions, in a ketchup vinegar base. For the bratwurst I went straight up with some brown deli mustard. Awesome! Next visit, I'm trying a chili cheese dog for sure.\nThe onion rings taste like an onion loaf, but not super peppery. They have a great batter here, but I like that you can still taste the onion and there isn't too much batter. The Loganberry shake is a must order. The perfect sweet creamy drink to offset the spicy Italian Sausage. From what I understand loganberry is a Western NY flavor, because you don't see it around these here parts too much. It's like a red blackberry. I have no idea if it was loganberry flavored ice cream or vanilla ice cream with loganberry syrup. Whatever it is, order it and you will be happy. I can't wait until the next time I'm in Phoenix (or Buffalo) to get me a charcoal grilled dog at Ted's. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/teds-hot-dogs-tempe?select=HYh6Dv4htWxebTjRMwgh6g#OCLoB-p-pzUUNcCib8xK-Q"

Awfully long wait for everything.\nIt was going to be an hour wait at Monty's blue plate diner or lazy Jane's Café so we decided to go to the fair Oaks diner because it was empty. We should have waited.\nWe had a group of 3, and sat down at the counter. After 10 minutes of sitting there, the waitress comes over and says \"A big order just went in ahead of you, so it's going to be a wait for the food\". I look around, and half the tables are empty, so I figure maybe it will be an extra 15 minutes. I ask if I can just quickly get a cinnamon roll and a glass of milk. Both are sitting in front of me behind the counter. 20 minutes later and having asked twice, I am still sitting there waiting. At this point, we have been waiting for 30 minutes in a half empty restaurant, and we haven't ordered, received menus, or gotten water.\nDuring this time, I had some time to look around the restaurant. It was filthy. Clean glasses had lipstick or food still stuck on them. Countertops and floors had ground in dirt indicative that they hadn't been cleaned in years. The kitchen could be seen from my spot at the counter, and I watched the cook wipe sweat from his forehead with a towel, and then grab toast by hand to throw it on the griddle without washing his hands and changing his gloves. MMMM, yummy. I love sweat soaked toast! I also love it when the sweat rag is used for wiping down counters. \nWe finally order, and I ask again if I can have a cinnamon roll and a glass of milk. 10 minutes later, and after a fourth request, it is basically thrown at me. The milk is warm. The cinnamon bun is stale and nasty. I finished neither. \n20 minutes later, I ask our waitress if our food was actually cooking yet. If it wasn't cooking yet, I just wanted to leave. She snidely responds, \"I warned you that it was going to be a wait when you sat down\". I replied that I didn't complain about how long it was taking. I simply wanted to know if our food was cooking or not yet because if it wasn't cooking yet, my family just wanted to pay for the milk, cinnamon roll, and coffee, and to leave. Without checking in the kitchen, she rudely snapped back \"it's cooking ok. WAIT!\" \n1 hour and 20 minutes after our arrival, our orders came to the table one plate at a time. 10 minutes after that, all three plates had arrived. My scrambled eggs were completely overcooked and dry/crusty. My hash browns, which were requested extra crispy were cold and soggy. There was also a surprise chunk of mystery meat in the middle, which I surmised to be a stray bit of sausage from another dish cooked on the same griddle. My toast wasn't toasted and was soaked with butter. \nMy father had oatmeal. He said it was instant oatmeal and they did a bad job. He could have made better from a packet at home in 5 minutes. The \"fruit\" on the oatmeal was basically strawberry sauce. His toast on the side was black. \nMy mother ordered a veggie scrambler. The vegetables \"tasted old\" she said. The eggs were way overcooked and dry/crusty. Two pieces of her toast weren't toasted, and the other two pieces were black. \nI paid $27 including a 15% tip that I left. I deeply regret having passed on waiting an hour to sit down at Monty's Blue Plate diner. I will never go back to the Fair Oaks Diner. I urge you not to go either."

    "text": "By no means am I a regular at Ruby Tuesday's but I have been here enough times in the past several years to know a few important things. \nOne, I love their salad bar. It is always fresh and has some great topping and greens options. I have to get the salad bar every time I come in. \nTwo, I was disppointed after not having been in a while to see that their menu had changed drastically. They used to be known for their burgers. Today, some of the burgers are still there but not like they used to be. For instance, I was impressed that they had a bison burger in the past. Now, it is no where to be found.\nThree, given the change to their menu, I have found other items to be quite satisfying. I think I have tried something different each time I have gone in during my last few visits. Most recently I tried the new spicy chicken tacos. They were indeed spicy. Not too overwhelming though. It was enough spice to make its presence known in a big way. Spicy grilled chicken, sauteed onion and bell pepper, cheese, cabbage and salsa in a soft flour tortilla was very good. There were two on a plate. \nThose two tacos plus my self-assembled salad were satisfying enough on their own. For some reason, though, I was unable to pass up dessert tonight. The cheese cake was calling me. So I answered the call. I'm glad I did. It was a thick cheese cake. At least three inches tall and topped with raspberry sauce and crushed fresh berries. It was delicious and it filled me to the top. I went home with a full belly and a happy heart."

It is a relief and joy to have an artisanal bakery shop open to the public in Las Vegas, and being relatively close to our side of town, we frequently shop there like a corner bakery.\nThis store is different than a pattiserie, no croissants or danishes here; instead you will find unique and one of a kind bread loaves that will tempt you with their ingredients.\nNow that we're starting to see the emerging independent artisan shops popping up in Vegas, it's starting to transform itself from a tourist-centric city into a community of urban dwellers who have the taste level for quality products and service.\nWalking into this tiny shop, there is a relatively small selection of breads; here it's not about quantity but quality. The interior is set up as a modern French country, with Baguettes and loaves of bread set up in wicker baskets along the walls. In addition, they sell fruit jams from Oregon Shippers. We tried a couple of them; they were absolutely delicious! \nMaster Baker Carlos Pereira has been baking and serving bread wholesale to all the Casinos in Vegas since 1999, and now her has set up shop to serve the public with his delicious, carb loaded creations. Read about his bio and the history of Bon Breads on the website, it will make you appreciate the art of bread making and the dedication of one man in culinary industry. And it's great that he is part of Las Vegas history; it gives a sense of pride about this place!\nCherry Walnut Bread: We tried something different this time; we bought the Cherry Walnut Bread; this bread had a heartier texture, with the sweet tartness of the cherries mixed with the nutty walnut, this was a delicious departure from our mainstay breads.\nThere are no preservatives in Bon Breads, so you have to consume them relatively soon- a good tip if you think you wanna buy a lot and save them for later. This is more in the tradition of European bakery tradition, where shoppers would go everyday to the bake shop for their daily bread.\nWhite Chocolate Bread: The White Chocolate Bread is our absolute favorite; it has a fresh, soft chewy texture with bits of white chocolate sweetness that is terribly addictive. it does not last very long in the house; it's perfect with our morning rocket fuel coffee!\nWe are so excited that this bakery is available to us and hope that it stays here for a very long time!!"

I'm giving it 2 stars because it wasn't terrible, but it definitely was NOT good. \nMy girl friends and I stumbled into this place at 5 or 6am after my bachelorette party because our cabbie recommended it and it was right next to the Riviera where we were staying. \nUs: Can we walk back to Riviera in our heels from there?\nCabbie: Girl, you can CRAWL.\nNuff said. Let's go THERE.\nWe got a wide variety of stuff- corned beef & hash, biscuits & sausage gravy, buffalo chicken wrap, something else, and something else (sorry, the night was a bit hazy haha). We tried a bite of everyone else's food, and not one of us 5 girls were the least bit impressed. \nNext time I'm in Vegas, I'll go to the 24 hour Indian place inside Riviera if I'm hungry in the middle of the night/morning. Too bad I didn't find out about it until my last 2 hours there."

Close by to I-215 beltway, grocery store (Vons, Albertsons, Glaciers, Wal-Mart), and much of everything else is nearby. Strip of about 15mins away.\nCONS: LOUD - Not necessary the most quietest of places because it's under the flight path. Walls are thin. If you live in a corner unit, be prepare to pay A LOT for utilities. Doesn't seem like there are any insulation if any. You can hear your neighbors next door and downstairs. Units are cheaply built. Only nice equipment is the granite countertop. Everything else in the unit is cheap. Carpet is terrible, bathroom and shower is decent. One of the most ANNOYING thing is the damn A/C -HEATER UNIT. IT'S THE LOUDEST MOTHERFUNKER ON THE MARKET. Whenever the unit is on, you cannot have a normal conversation. I feel bad for the people living on the ground floor, especially the ones with 2-3 units in front of their bedroom windows. OFFICE staff are flat out LIARS. Remember to get everything in writing.\nFinal note - Remember that if you refer someone to this place, you get $250, what office staff failed to mention is they need to live in the unit for 30 days before you receive the credit on your rent. For example, if they moved in July 25, you will not get credit until August 26. That $250 rental credit will show up until you receive October's rent statement. If you moved out at the end September, then you're S.O.L. No referral credit for you because the complex sends out the monthly bill 15 days prior to the due date, meaning you'll get September rent bill August 16th."

On top of that their are many top notch restaurants within walking distance.

With each new tray of sushi being brought out the staff simply took the tong from the old plate and put it on the new plate.

By the end the tongs were visibly filthy. I mean - sauces and rice and whatever being transferred from the old plate to the new and the servers just took it in stride.

That's good enough. \nIt's a cafe...inside South Point. Don't expect much and don't drive all the way here for the food. I was meeting up friends who lived across the street so, I ended up here with them. I told them my dietary restrictions and they came up with the idea of ordering a turkey wrap (with chipotle mayo in the side) for me since I had to drive across town.\nEveryone else got steak, omelet and a tuna sandwich. The general comment from everyone at our table: \"it was edible\". My turkey wrap came with French fries which is a weakness of mine. My friend knew it wasn't cheat day for me yet so, he asked for potato salad for him to eat. It came with fries anyway. I ate maybe 2 or 3 fries...or maybe 7 - they were good! But our nice server brought us a bowl of potato salad anyway. \nThe food was alright but it was the service that I liked. They were busy but our server was still oh-so pleasant and efficient."

First of all, we booked a two queen bed Pyramid room. When checking in, the woman helping us never mentioned that there were no more two bed rooms and that they had put us in a one bed room. It wouldn't have bothered us to be in the one bed room (we like to have two beds to put stuff on top of the other bed instead of on the floor) but it wouldn't have hurt to let us know. When we went back to the check in to ask about it, the woman gave us an attitude so we just made it work instead of fighting it.\nAlso, the woman at the check out desk told us the wrong elevator to go on to get to our room so we spent an hour and a half trying to find our room. We stopped and asked three people who worked for the Luxor and none of them had any idea where our room was! That's not okay.\nNext, we noticed two different trays of room service that had been placed out in the hallway near our room to be cleaned up. The next day, those trays were still sitting out in the hallway. After the third day, we called the front desk to complain because it was starting the stink very badly. Finally by the fourth day it had been cleaned up. Gross!\nWe only put the privacy sign on the door when we were sleeping, but some how still got skipped over for two days when it came to room service.\nIt also really sucked that to get to the monorail, we had to walk through the Luxor and Excalibur, go across the street to New York New York, then back across to the MGM. You already do a ton of walking in Las Vegas but this just adds to it. This was our fault though for not figuring it out before booking a hotel room.\nNo wonder the rates for this place were so cheap. We won't be staying here again."

I assumed I would need a crown because of the size of the chip and frankly, I'm terrified of going to the dentist. \nHis staff is extremely friendly and helpful and they did their best to make me feel comfortable. They also assisted me in finding a dental plan to make any work I need less expensive. Dr Levinson was very pleasant and gave me several options and his opinions for fixing my tooth. He didn't try to up-sell me on the repair and when he did the work, he kept taking the time to make sure the repair felt natural and that I wasn't in any discomfort. \nI don't think anyone likes going to the dentist, but I wouldn't hesitate to go back here and I plan to do just that.

We manage to find the way downstairs and there's a line for that too! \nMost of the time there we stayed in the smaller room playing more hip hop. The DJ was the worst ever!

You're really going to just play only like 10 seconds of a song??\nWe tried to go into the main room but that was just a disaster and ended up back in the smaller room.

The service is impeccable and the food is second to none.\nDuring this visit I took my wife for a romantic dinner for Valentine's Day. We were early for our reservation so we headed to the bar for some \"Bar Bites until it was time to be seated at our booth. Once seated Ed was our server and he was great! He brought over the \"meat cart\" with all of the different cuts of steak that they offered and went over each steak. The cart also has all of the vegetables they offer as well.\nWe both started off with a few cocktails. I had the French Raspberry Mortini and she had the Chocolatini Mortini. By this time the huge loaf of onion bread was brought and placed on our table. Next we both had salads. I had the Caesar and she had the Wedge. For our steaks we both had the single cut fillet cooked Cajun Style which were seasoned and cooked to perfection. Absolutely the best, most tender steak I have ever eaten in my life. It was like steak flavored butter. It melted in your mouth. I added a utterly amazing crab cake to mine and she added colossal shrimp to hers. To accompany our entrees I added garlic mashed potatoes to mine and the wife added green beans to hers.\nFor dessert we shared the world famous Morton's Lava Chocolate cake with ice cream. What a way to end one of the best meals we have ever had."

What is with the stupid TV playing ESPN? It pretty much guarantees any man with even just a fleeting interest in sports is going to stare straight at the stupid tv and not at me. It took a long time to get my hair and makeup to look this way and I would rather he look at me and not at the game taped earlier in the damn day. \nBars, especially high end martini bars like this need to be bold and leave the TVs out of the equation.

    "text": "I am quite surprised at the current ratings of this restaurant! (1.5 stars), I guess mainly because the lack of reviews. I actually have been really wanting to try this restaurant since I live close by Santa Fe Station and see the specials for this restaurant all the time. And since Stations Casinos is so kind as to offer dining credits to us all the time, it was time for some Mexican food!\nWell, this is your average chain restaurant. The food was very average. The items we had were not AMAZING and were not horrible either. I have posted pictures of the food we did order.\nI would actually rate this place 3.5 stars. The bonus for the chips and dip you get when you first get seated. The chips were warm and they offer 4 different dips! (3 levels of spicy, and a bean dip.) I loved it all! I guess almost filled up on that alone, but I wanted real food.\nMe and the bf ordered the Cabo Party Platter $11.99 (appetizer) to share and the Combo #6 ($12.99) to share. The appetizer was pretty good. But not great. More than half the plate (quite a good sized order) was of nachos which were not that great, but the dip that came with us (an orangey colored creamy dip) was awesome for everything on the platter. The quesadillas were ... bland. But the other items on the platter were good.\nAnd Combo #6. Slightly disappointing. The Chili Relleno was just bad. Pretty tasteless. The Chicken Tamale was also disappointing. Barely had any filling. But the beef taco was yummy!\nI think we filled up too much on chips and saved no room for dessert. Bummer. I wanted to try the deep fried ice cream. Oh well.\nService was not too bad. We got seated right away and got the chips and dip right away and she actually explained each dip. But we were so into the menu and chips we didn't realize nobody came to take our drink orders. Until about 10 minutes later. But then they took our food orders right after. And it was less than 15 minutes and we got our food. The server came back to check on us a couple times. All was well. The booths and tables were clean. I do agree about the uniforms, they suck.\nOverall, average. But kudos for the chips and dip :)"

    "text": "Warehouse mentality, irresistible sale prices, and halfway-decent beer selection (best in town, but still quite lacking), characterize Lee's. It's certainly not the place to go to learn about wine, and the staff really don't know very much about wine, but it's not a bad place to shop if you don't care that much or if you really know what you're doing. Despite all the little things that annoy me at this place, I'm usually there once a week anyway.\nSome time mid-January, I bought the last bottle of Domaine Des Roches Macon-Ige. I hadn't had it in several years, and was quite pleasantly surprised for $8 a bottle. I went back the following week to pick up some more, and they had just gotten a ridiculously huge order delivered. I'm talking pallettes sextouple stacked in the back, almost to the 30-foot-high roof joists. Way too much for one order. Anyway, their inventory showed several cases of the wine, but it was obviously buried somewhere in this huge order. Here it is, a week into April, and they still haven't dug it out yet.\nThe beer department really vexes me too. The Belgian beer selection is pretty mediocre compared to what I'm used to in Detroit. On top of that, in many cases, they sell one type from a brand and not the others. They have Delerium Nocturnum, but not Delerium Tremens, and they didn't stock the Delerium Noel (or Duinen, for that matter, made in the same brewery). They have Corsendonk Brown, probably the single Belgian beer besides Chimay or Duvel you would expect to find in any old liquor store, but they lack the Pale, and didn't stock the Christmas. I don't get it; Corsey even puts out magnums and bigger of their Christmas beer, which stores like this could sell at HUGE margins above the regular stuff, and people always buy it, too! Their loss.\nThe other annoying thing about the beer section is that they let things run out completely before restocking anything. A couple months ago, I bought them out of Hop Ottin' IPA, and the Belgian and British shelves were so sparsely stocked, it looked like they were planning on getting rid of the beer section totally.\nI probably wouldn't buy my liquor elsewhere (unless I were special ordering, in which case I'd get it from Khoury's), and there are some ridiculous sales here too. Not the best environment, but not bad overall."

It's a pretty small restaurant, but we got the best seats right alongside the window (with no glass) to observe passerbys or for them to observe us 12 girls. The food was family style and we had ordered boky choy, kung pao shrimp, mongolian beef, ma pao tofu, and penang noodles. My favs were the mongolian beef, penang noodles, and the kung pao shrimp. Portions were pretty big. My friends also loved the bok choy but wished they would cut the pieces a bit smaller because they were hard to chew. If you like PF Changs, it is similar to that type of \"Chinese\" cuisine where it's an attempt to recreate Chinese dishes with a modern twist. Service was A plus and I even received 2 complimentary desserts: coconut ice cream and a mango pudding/custard. I don't like coconut and the mango dish was confusing - some of the party said it tasted like \"refrigerator\". If that sounds confusing, imagine something you left uncovered in the fridge for a few days. In any other city, this might stand alone because of the concept and decor, but here in Vegas it's not quite cutting it."

My fiance ordered a teriyaki chicken bowl, and I got the meatloaf and chicken noodle soup. The soup was pretty good. The meatloaf portion was HUGE - three very thick slices smothered in gravy.

There is a 24 hour Starbucks connected to the lobby too, score! Also, food options right when you walk into the mall so you really don't have to go outside if you don't want to. It's also connected to Planet Hollywood so if you are feeling like you need a gambling fix immediately, just hop over there. However, if you are tired of the crowds, loud noises and smoke, step back into the Hilton oasis and relax. There is a bar in the lobby as well as a lounge area, just so nice. \nWe experienced room service as well which was great. The food was pretty good, portions were plenty and the service was nice. Someone mentioned the views not being that great but we had a 17th floor room and overlooked the direction of the Wynn and it was so nice!

I love tapas. If I could go into any restaurant and order things tapas style, I would. A small plate of food to share is my idea of perfection, so I was so delighted to read good reviews about the tapas place a five minute walk from my office.\nWe ordered four tapas and one dessert for two people, plus a couple of extra servings of bread to mop up the delicious sauces, which with a healthy glass of wine and bottle of beer came to about £40. This was more than enough food for us, we left feeling totally satisfied. We ordered one of the daily specials and the garlic prawns, but the two winners were the fallen tower of aubergine, beef tomato and mozzarella, and the pork ribs baked in chilli, tomato and honey. I totally recommend trying these two dishes, they were sublime. Upon reading so many reviews online, we finished off the course with the 'crying cake' which was so delicious. A warm chocolate pudding that when prodded, 'cries' rich chocolate sauce. Despite not being much of a dessert person, this totally blew my mind.\nAs I mentioned earlier though, it really was the staff that did it for me. They brought the daily specials board over to us which was actually a really nice touch, it wasn't hard to catch their attention if we needed extra bread or drinks despite being quite busy, they brought the dishes out one at a time in perfect succession so nothing went cold and they even gave us a complimentary shot of lychee and vodka at the end of our meal with the bill.

    "text": "As hole in the walls goes...this ain't no surprise to locals and many out-of-towners. The key buy here is to sit outside in the relatively smokey casino portion (under the hoods and next to the member rewards card center) and NOT (I repeat NOT) to sit inside the Broiler restaurant. \nWhy not you ask?\n2 words: STEAM POTS\nAdd to that the guys who cook up their crazy concoctions - JJ and Greg - as well as the cool under pressure server Dolores (aka Dolly) and you won't be disappointed. It's like having your favorite sports' dream team serving you up some serious good eats. And...unlike many LV shows, you won't have to pay a pretty penny for these guys to entertain you. And that's kind of what this is....steam pot seafood dishes (pan roast, bouillabaisse, cioppino, gumbo, etc) made fresh to order EVERY order with a show to boot. Think of this as Benihana with steam pots. And just like when you were a kid and the tepanyakia chefs would entertain with their knives and histrionics....well, you get that here with ribs and jabs to customers sitting at the \"bar\".\nJust a quick note: do not confuse this place with the other Station casino copies - e.g., Tidelands Oyster bar elsewhere. This place is all about the chefs (JJ and Greg)...those other places make the same dishes...but the skill and adaptability to changing orders on the fly is not there. Plus some of these places don't use steam pots. They cook it on a stove top. Boo! \nWhat's so awesome about the steam pots then?\nFor starters, the steam pots NEVER overcook your precious cargo load of seafood these guys put into your dish. Seriously, everytime I've ordered something here, I've been amazed at 1) the quality of seafood, 2) the portions of seafood and 3) how perfectly tender and succulent the seafood is cooked each time. The other thing is just watching these guys cook up their creations using the pots....it's SO cool! \nWe usually order the combo pan roast which runs you a hefty $20....but if you consider the fact that you get huge portions of shrimp, lobster and big pieces of lump crab...PLUS you could easily feed 3 people with the servings you get. Well, it's not a bad deal right? What's also best is just being able to specify your specific heat level in ANY dish. They will accommodate you. I've requested 4 fresh habaneros in my pan roast before...but the usual scale of 1 - 10 applies for those not accustomed to the H-bomb, as I refer to it.\nIf a tomato cream-based pan roast doesn't suit you, they have several other dishes that are made exclusively in their steam pots like seafood bouillabaisse (w/ crab legs, mussels, clams, shrimp), gumbo (e.g., crab only, shrimp only, combo), pasta dishes (vongole, shrimp, etc.), as well as an Alaskan chowder, jambalaya and red beans and rice. I've never tried there namesake (oysters) here, but I've heard good things...I'm just a bit of an oyster snob so if I don't know the source of them (Kumomotos, Blue Points, etc), I usually shy away from eating them. But then again, why bother? B/c all you need to know is that they have STEAM POTS FTMFW!!!!\nOne final word of advice, it packs up in a line here around dinner time (waits can be as long as an hour or more depending on party size - only ~18 seats at the bar). Since everything is first come first serve, don't expect any favoritism or joking around with skipping the line. Dolly, JJ and Greg are serious when it comes to that line. Think \"soup nazi\". If you're short on time, go between the lunch hour and dinner time (1 - 5pm) for almost immediate service. Also, if you're a frequent gambler or you get mailings from the Station casino rewards programs...you can score some free eats (e.g., $45 coupons). If not, go sign up at the booth next door and you'll see what I mean (hopefully you can use it on your next visit). Also, if you're shy about eating a whole $20 bowl of food...just say you're sharing one of their creations. They're totally okay with that. And yes, beer and wine can be ordered here. Last visit, they got rid of Gordon Biersch in favor of Kona Longboard - awesome. Finally, can't find the place? Look for the line of Asians here. Seriously...we know good seafood. 'nuff said.\nDespite the OJ debacle of Palace Station, Oyster Bar should not be overlooked on your next off-strip visit to LV. Makes me wonder...\"what if OJ ate here?\" Ask Dolly...she'll know."

I like the transitions between a solid stage and pool. However, I would have liked to see more stunts and flying around. I know the main theme here is water but they pretty much just jumped into the giant pool over and over. The comedic portion was not as good as kooza's but it did get a few laughs out of me. The music really shined at this show."

The salmon avocado roll is a personal favorite for me. ^^v Yums. \nThe tostadas are $1 during happy hour so it's a good value. Speaking of which, 4-6pm is happy hour.

    "text": "I'm a pretty experienced shooter, and I generally don't like indoor, square ranges, but American Shooters is a great range (and store) for two reasons: a wide selection of really amazing weapons, and great staff.\nOn the weapons front, they have a wide (20-30?) selection of title II automatic weapons, including M4/M16s, the Kriss V \"recoilless\" submachine gun, and some medium machine guns (M60, etc.). Each of these is $10-20k at least, and difficult to purchase (since they're made after 1986). While the range charges a lot to use them, it's actually not a bad deal for what they are. Still, burning through $50 in 5 minutes is not something I do lightly.\nThey also have a wide selection of handguns and other semi-automatic weapons, at fairly normal ($10) rental rates -- ironically they were selling 1000 round 9mm for $249, about $20 more than discounted online prices; a lot of ranges would sell the same thing for $400+.\nThey also have a cool prism system for doing tactical simulations (basically, video screens that run scenarios, which you can shoot); a bit pricey since it requires 2 staff to operate, but probably worth it. Range fees otherwise are fairly normal.\nThe staff at the range were all helpful; I was with a group of people with varying levels of shooting experience, and the range officers helped make sure everyone was safe (which let the more experienced people enjoy themselves without babysitting the others the whole time).\nThe store is great too, although only accessories, ammunition, and apparel can be easily purchased by non-Nevada residents (state law changed for rifles and shotguns on 1 July 2011, but no one has updated their procedures to sell to out of state residents yet). They have a great selection of weapons and accessories (including sound suppressors!), and helpful staff.\nThis would definitely be my choice for a Las Vegas range and store; the only alternative is driving outside Clark County, or the Internet."

There was seven tables at 645pm, a little quiet but we were able to get seated immediately. Our hostess gave us menus; when asked for a beer -wine menu she said all were being used! Really? 7 tables! But our waiter\nLuke brought the menus over right away. He was vey friendly, attentive and knowledgable, especially when it came to the tap beers. Great selection.\nIt was half price apps until 7pm so we tried the charcuterie board; nicely presented with three meats and three cheeses, pepperonis, arugula, roasted strips of red bell peppers and slivers of Kalamata olives. Fair amount of food but for $10 at full price I would expect higher quality meats.\nI had the Philly steak sandwich all the way with onion rings and chipotle mayo dipping sauce. The steak is shaved in house, tender and plentiful but could have used a little seasoning. Onion rings were made from real onions, not the paste filled style; but my disappointment was the chipotle dipping mayo. No muy caliente at all! It tasted like annatto colored mayo; not even a hint of smokiness or heat.\nMy wife had the white pizza; very nicely done. A short bite at the center and a good chewy crust. Very NY ish. \nWe will return again to try other dishes and we wish them success for the future. Definitely a place for a cold draft avid a game. How about stocking NCs Red Oak?"

During the holidays, I did make some special trips for Eggnog milkshakes.

The Villas pool can get a bit busy during the peak summer months and there are tons of kids every where. You can also take the shuttle or drive over to the main hotel and swim in their main pool that has a lazy river, a beach and the wave runner thing - which is $45 to do. \nThere are daily activities going on every day and some you have to pay for. Same goes with the main hotel pool. \nService here is pretty friendly. Especially at the front desk. When we checked in, the guy at the front desk allowed my son to come sit on the check in counter and he helped him make our room keys. That was pretty awesome and my son loved it. \nAs a timeshare owner, the housekeeping came only once - on Tuesday. If we want them to come more often, there are fees for it depending on what you wanted: $8 for towel service, $25 full room cleaning, etc. \nCabana rental used to be a flat $50 per day fee, but now they are charged based on tiers and which tier you want to use. \nThe only thing I don't like is how the pool closes so early - 8 pm. And the slide closes at 6 pm. Another negative is that the wi-fi there is horrible. I always end up having to use my 4G network to get better internet which eats into my data plan."

But country western bars usually push it a bit too far for me. It just feels like most folks are pushing way too hard to be something they want to be, but aren't. \nThe one thing I'll give this place is that I'm guessing a lot of these folks still work the land. It's up near South Mountain, in Phoenix but just down the road from Laveen where farming is still a big part of life. Some of these folks wouldn't know a hoe from a ho, but they just like the music.

My server was nice enough though to bring me some extra chili sauce. \nI poked around my noodles and noticed they were really sparing with the ingredients.

The service was not the problem, although if she would have told me the Blue Moon was almost 7 dollars, I would have bought a six-pack of it on my way home instead. $5 would have been reasonable.\nThe real problem what what I ate. We ordered the soft pretzels and cheese as an appetizer - they were fine. As a Canadian, when I saw they added a special - Poutine - I had a nostalgia moment and ordered it. It was a long way from the delicious, savory poutine from my homeland. For those of you who have never eaten poutine, it would fit right in with southern style cooking. Take french fries, add creamy cheese curds (or if you're not sure where to buy those, chopped up braided mozzarella works well too), top with fresh, steamy brown gravy. The gravy and heat from the fries melts the cheese into a melty mountain of yum.\nThis was not what I experienced. First of all, the cheese curds were breaded and deep fried (another special appetizer they had). Instead of the poutine effect of creamy, melty, cheesy goodness, it was more like soggy clumps. I made due, it's been a while since I've had poutine. I asked for no pico de gailo, because I had no idea why it was included in their poutine. I didn't get any as part of the order, so once again, i praise the server for taking a proper order. There was enough gravy, but there was just something...off about it. It was very subtle, but there was a peculiar sourness to it that was enough for me to catch on my palette, but not enough for me to expect anything was wrong other than an odd recipe for one of my all-time favorite meals. \nThe abdominal pain started at 2 am, about 4 hours after consuming the meal. I'm a tall guy so things take their time digesting...usually. I was not prepared for the razor like purge that followed. Without sharing too many details of the horror stories that went on in that room, I will say that finally, at 12 pm today, I stopped feeling sick.\nNow I don't know if it was the cheese curds or the gravy (leaning towards the gravy), but I feel like there were some definite corners cut in the kitchen. If you're going to be serving food to people, what's coming out of the kitchen is a reflection on both the chef staff and the management. You need to have standards. Taste your food. Keep it consistent. \nThis is the only location that I've ever had such an experience. I hope this criticism serves as constructive, to prevent others from getting sick from the food. Please be conscious of the freshness of ingredients!"

The blunt force of the bullet or poison dart or whatever they used must have instantly rendered him unconscious and quickly drained the life from his furry white body.\nGod only knows how the couriers-de-bois managed to sweep his lifeless carcass from the woods of the townships to the heart of the plateau with furious speed and medical accuracy. I think that the body was still deliciously warm when he arrived on our stunning table.\nHe arrived de-furred and sans-le-tete but otherwise quite whole in the center of our dining area. The staff quickly and clearly disemboweled the creature and portioned the useable meat into distinct sections for each of the four of us. This was served over a delightfully fresh mix of vegetables and potato-based mash. This rabbit did not die in vain.\nThe name \"La Salle A Manger\" may be better expressed as \"Le Plancher D'Abattage\", but if you're a carnivore you're in for a treat. The wine list is outstanding. The service is exceptional. The crowd is gorgeous. The ambiance is slaughterhouse-chic. \nA wonderful place to explore. Worth every shot."

Chile rellenos are HOT, beware. New Mexican enchiladas are good with the red or green chile. I recommend a fried egg on top."

Me and the guys walked in, no admission (cause we're AWESOME) while people paid behind us (cause they were NOT AWESOME). We walk to the bar, ordered four rounds of patron shots for all of us and the night was just Legen...wait for it.. Dary!\nThe lighting, decor and music was just spectacular. Very \"loungey\" of course... But it still consisted a decent dance floor... \nThe dance floor was epic, I remember being drunk while the guys were watching this guy pop lockin'.. So they literally throw my drunk ass in the circle telling me to battle this guy...... All I remember was the guy walking away with his posse... (If you are reading this guy, I'm sorry for killing your groove).\nBy the way, I don't recall this place ever playing a Beatles song......"

    "text": "I love how posh and swanky this hotel and casino is. The hotel lobby is very upscale, modern and I especially love the pillars that they have with ever changing screens - I'm mesmerized by the pretty flashing lights and colors. \nI admired all of the glitz and glam spread throughout the hotel and casino. I love shiny, sparkly things and the massive chandelier was dramatic and incredible. \nWe stayed in 2 different rooms here: \nThe first one is the standard room and it had a great view of the strip and the Bellagio fountain. The room was spacious, new, and clean. I loved the sexy interior decor, art, and the beautiful wallpaper throughout. Super stylish! There is no bath tub, just a large walk in shower with a floor to ceiling glass window view to the bedroom. You can close the blinds if you prefer privacy, or you can keep it open for a private show. You pick. \nWe also stayed in the well appointed king terrace suite with a phenomenal view overlooking the strip and the Bellagio fountains. It was such an uber swanky room! The room was long and spacious with a great big suede blue couch in the living room area. It also has a kitchen sink area with a microwave, mini fridge, and dish washer. It had a nice spacious closet area with a large mirrored wardrobe closet and a cushioned chest to sit. \nThe king bed was separated in its own room with sliding doors for privacy. The bed was ultra plush and comfy. The sheets were soft and crisp - I slept like a baby. \nThe best part was modern bathroom! Jack and Jill sink, a beautifully wallpapered private room with a toilet, an incredible separated bath area with a beautifully tiled standing shower with a floor to ceiling view to the bedroom and is also connected to a gorgeous and luxurious Japanese soaking tub that has a opening to overlook the bedroom and a large window that overlooks the Las Vegas Strip and the Bellagio Fountains. The tub was so tastefully done and the view of the strip in the day and in the evening were exquisite! \nI spent a lot of my time enjoying the breeze on the attached terrace. They had a nice patio lounge set in their sexy blue theme color. I caught so many Bellagio fountain shows, I lost count. I would say that the terrace suite rooms offers the best views of the fountain on the strip. That view can't be matched. \nBoth rooms were well stocked with toiletries from Co Bigelow - I love their products! They are travel sized which is never enough for my long hair, but the staff was very friendly and accommodating and refilled my stock with however many I needed. \nThey are very dog friendly - My dogs are not small, one is over 40 lbs and the other is 26 lbs. Upon arriving to our room, they had 2 gift bags on the bed for my 2 dogs filled with a portable potty bags in a Eco friendly wrist case and also bags of treats. The doggy park (not really a park) but an enclosed potty area for them on the pool deck floor was very small and narrow but it did the job. \nThey also have the best restaurants there! We went to their Wicked Spoon buffet for brunch and dinner. But I prefer their buffet during dinner! Many unique, tasty culinary options and their gelato bar is incredible. Secret pizza is so damn delicious as well! Love the thin crispy fresh out of the oven pizza. Expensive, but worth it! \nLast but not least, hotel guests can enter the marquee nightclub free without waiting in line, which is great since that line can be rather obnoxious. I'm not sure if it's always free or at a discounted price, but the night we stayed it was complimentary."

Their understanding of human movement, and the stress of life's daily occurrences on your body is some of the most thorough I've experienced. I typically get massage to alleviate stress and tension in my neck, upper back and shoulders that comes with a desk/computer job. Then I ended up being part of a car accident and having whiplash injuries that gave me a whole new set of issues and exacerbated my existing ones. Luckily I had massages scheduled, so it became like one of my therapies. Lily got me moving and really instigated healing in some very sore muscles. I didn't even know I was sore in a few spots until she started working on them... I have had dozens of massages and this was not only relaxing, but more therapeutic than I had experienced at some other spas. \nIt should be mentioned there are also some awesome pampering touches with your massage.... Eucalyptus scented covers on the face pillow = AmaZinG! A nice rub on your feet and then a moist towel to wipe off any excess oil/lotion before you get up. You also get a warm towel under your neck once you roll over onto your back. \nI can't say enough good things. They are friendly, welcoming, understanding, knowledgeable and have an all-around really good vibe about them. The location is very easy to get to and the hours are accommodating, including weekends and evenings."

    "text": "SW makes the best steak in Vegas.\nKind of a bold statement for a guy who's eaten at dozens of the best rated steakhouses across the country, and probably dozens in Vegas alone. An even bolder statement for a city known for luxury, extravagance and world class restaurants, particularly its steakhouses.\nI went with very low expectations. I love the Wynn and all, but not for its food (can we say most overrated buffet?). But we had some rooms here, and the SW was chosen out of convenience. It was also one of the few my buddies and I hadn't tried yet. The reviews I read were positive, but not gushing which isn't good for a town over-saturated with five star reviews. I was warned about cheesey water-light shows with giant frog puppets. The pictures I saw her on Yelp didn't show me dishes that looked to be particularly special. To be honest I tried to lead my friends over to CUT which had been spectacular on a previous trip. But I relented. And thank God I did.\nThere was a wait so we grabbed a couple of Macallan's at the bar. And we waited.\nOur table gets called and I walk into a giant dining area. It's reminiscent of a giant ballroom with giant glass windows on one side giving a view of said frog puppet show. I wasn't impressed. The decor was less than promising. It didn't scream hip like N9NE, nor sexy and dark like CUT or craftsteak. It looked like the restaurant tried to go for a posh elegance look, but got tired half way. Not a promising start.\nThen the food began to come out.\nFantastic. Start-to-finish. \nFor bread they give you cheesy bacon bread, as if they thought you might not get enough meat during your meal. It was so deliciously salty and fluffy and different. We asked for more than one basket.\nThe steak I chose was a bone-in rib eye, my go-to cut about 90% of the time. I know when it's good and when it's just alright and this was toe-curling, eyes-in-the-back-of-the-head orgasmic. Perfect sear and crust on the outside. Perfectly medium rare on the inside. It's honestly difficult to get this just right so I usually err on the side of rare+ in case it comes out overcooked. This was medium rare done right, where the meat has the slightest crunch on the outside and almost melts with every bite, gushing with flavor with each bite.\nMost sides don't even get a mention in my reviews, but the black truffle creamed corn which we got on a server's recommendation was amazing. I'd go back just for the corn alone. You cannot eat here without getting the creamed corn as a side. The mac and cheese and au gratin potatoes were pretty good too but not quite withdrawal-symptoms-inducing memorable.\nAs a male, red-blooded American, it is my God-given honor to eat right meat. It's almost a duty, given the forefathers who died to give me this freedom. I vote and I pay my taxes. God bless America and it's cattle industry. God bless the SW Steakhouse.\nAfter awhile, the frog puppet thing kind of grows on you."

Ellis Island is close enough for tourists and just far enough for the locals trying to avoid the brunt of the strip BS.\nEllis Island has been around since the 60's and they have DELICIOUS home brewed beers (stout, IPA, Amber Ale, root beer, light, or hefeweizen) for even a homeless persons budget on top of meal deals that will make the late night drinker (or smoker) beyond satisfied. They have karaoke in one bar room, a cafe in the other, and a middle bar that surrounded by their main games/tables.\nLocated just one cross street from the strip you can't beat the feel of older town vegas, with the prices and deals this place provides. There is also a Metro Pizza located inside the casino open during the day which a HUGE local favorite spot around Vegas.\nI've been sipping on a stout and eating loaded potato skins since I arrived and can definitely get used to this place... The security and bartenders were nicer than most places in Vegas and the place is very laid back.\n$7-10 cab ride (if that) from the strip and you will save a lot more heading here if you are on a budget rather than staying on the vampiric money sucking strip...\n5/5 stars for fusing what tourists/locals are looking for for right off the strip! A cheap good time!"

I came in knowing exactly what I wanted, made my purchase and my car was ready in about 25 minutes. \nThe only thing that was a little annoying was the hard sell they tried to put on me about purchasing rims. I politely said no, but they persisted and even put some on my car while they were putting my new tires on to show me how \"good they look.\" That was a little annoying since I was pretty clear to begin with that I wasn't interested. Once I said no again, they removed the rims and put my old ones back on along with my new tires. Aside from that little snafu, I was pleased with the service and have had good experiences here in the past when I came for tire checkups, so I probably wouldn't have any qualms about coming back in the future. I would just prefer they lay off the sales tactics a bit."

A nice thing about Citizens Bank is that, as of sometime last calendar year (2013), they will still notarize documents that have nothing to do with the bank. PNC, on the other hand, notarizes nothing unless it has something to do with PNC, even if you have an account with them. The location of this branch is good, right in the heart of the business section of Squirrel Hill. Parking can be a little tight, but not a major issue. I like the people working there."

We got a bacon cheese burger which was 13.50 but worse than a 2 dollar burger at your nearby fast food joint. It was worse than your elementary school burger with the exception that it was topped with lettuce, tomato, and bacon. \nThe so called breakfast wrap for 9.99 was filled simiply with egg. Overall i felt robbed - in fact i think i would have felt better if someone held me up for 25 dollars then i could eat my miseries away after with enjoyable food.\nDo yourself a favor and dont come here EVER.

Pushed to the back of Mandalay Bay, THEhotel is a modern, ultraluxe boutique-like hotel. The girl (or should I say THEgirl) who checked us in, Pia, was a godsend on Labor Day weekend for 5 bachelorette party-ready girls who wanted a swanky place to crash for a bit! After some searching, she was able to locate a room with 2 beds for us, and advised us (with a wink) of how to get extra keys and such in a 4-person max room. \nThe room was roomy, with 2 toilets, Philips flat screens in the bathroom, living and bedrooms, a separate living room with a couch, desk and small bar, and 2 queens in the bedroom. Everything was \"THE\" themed, down to THEtp (toiletpaper). \nFor dining, THEhotel has their own cafe, and also Mix Restaurant, which is an opulent Alain Ducasse offering worth trying. There is also Mix Lounge, which is a great nightlife option if you like luxurious settings without all the crowds (Pure, Tao). Since THEhotel is attached to Mandalay Bay, you also have their dining/nightlife options as well.\nTHEhotel has their own pool, which I did not visit. You also have access to Mandalay Bay's pool, which is a mini-waterpark of sorts that is worth checking out. Arrive early, as lounges are difficult to come by in peak season. The pool offers a wave pool, lazy river, beach (with seasonal concerts), multiple bars/grills, and even a small casino area with card tables. If you're more into a beach party, try getting into Moorea Beach Club, located just outside the pool area and above the poolside casino. There's usually a line to get in this topless pool, but this is where all the action is! \nPricewise, THEhotel is a little more than other Strip hotels, but is worth it if you want to escape the hustle and bustle of the city that never sleeps."

They are literally 2 miles away from my apartment. 6 minute drive. The second time, without notice.. the delivery fee jumped to $7. A significant increase. \nI really liked the food enough to order food from them.. Unfortunately, It's enough to never order delivery from them again - with that steep delivery charge. Doesn't seem worth it. I'd rather drive there.. but it seems a bit shady, so I'm not feeling good about supporting them again.

So, be sure to request the hot pot menu if that's what you want. It's a simple menu where you fill in what you want and they take care of the rest. \nFor The Husband and I, we ordered the Lamb Pot ($15.99) and we chose both types of broth, the regular and spicy one ($1 more). \nIn the meantime, we went to make our dipping sauces. There's a little station by the fridge where you can spoon up some sesame oil, peanut sauce, garlic and scallions. On the side, you can also find hot chili oil, chili sauce, vinegar, soy sauce, etc. While you're getting your sauces, don't forget to grab one of those long handled spoons and maybe an extra bowl for yourself. I forget that there's a lot of self service stations here, so you're more than welcome to help yourself to the hot tea and cold water available too. \nOur veggie platter included thin rice noodles, udon noodles, enoki mushrooms, squash, tomatoes, napa cabbage, tofu (2 kinds), corn, and zucchini. Our lamb platter arrived with shaved slices of raw lamb ready to be cooked. \nThis place was busy, with non-Asians as well. Most of the surrounding tables were doing hot pot too, but I did see a few bowls of soup noodles come out as well. \nOverall, it's a small restaurant that has its following.

No more patrons came in until we were leaving but that man was still there and looked like he was not leaving until he consumes all the salsa on the condiment bar. I am sooo disappointed...it was so good the first time."

We were greeted and sat on the patio. Weather was perfect. I ordered crab cakes and husband had a breakfast meal. He was very happy with his breakfast and beer. My Diet Coke tasted very heavy on the soda water and weak in flavor. But OK. Things happen. I was surprised by the crab cakes. I don't meet many foods I don't like, but the three small disks were barely breaded or coated at all. While slightly crunchy when the fork went in, I was never able to get it to stay together to carry to my mouth. It was warm crab salad in a thin toast shell. This was every one of them. Fine. At least they were edible. The sauce with a fancy French name that was served with it was nothing more than very salty thousand island dressing. No, really. I had my husband taste some and asked him what he thought and he said \"Thousand Island?\" I have had crab cakes in all sorts of locations. But for this price? I consider $8.99 ridiculous for the quality. It was so salty I was worried something might have soured or gone bad in it. My husband noted the TVs mounted outside just under the patio overhang, but remarked that with the bright sun surrounding it, there was no way the screen could be seen during the day. We won't be back. Also, how nice that the owner has friends willing to write lovely reviews, but so many negative experiences by so many people covering the same things is not a fluke. People aren't \"ugly\" because they choose to write a review that is not complimentary. I hope they get it together soon."

We had the sourdough french toast, fried chicken and waffles with cheddar and jalapeno peppers and bourbon bacon syrup. Splooge. Everywhere. For the price, the quantity and quality of the food they serve is unreal. Too bad I do not have two stomachs, because if I did, I would have ordered more. Every item on the menu was something I would order.\nI ordered a black IPA but the waitress brought a regular IPA. This wasn't a huge deal for me, but when I asked her about it she said she would check on it. She never came back or offer to change it to what I ordered. I let the beer sit assuming she would switch it out but it just got warm and I drank it after realizing she either forgot or blew me off. Again, not a big deal, but this place would have been 5 stars if it weren't for that."

I've been here a couple times now and I've been impressed by the flavors of the sauces. The gnocchi is out of this world b/c it's so garlicky and the potato dumplings are so tender; it's my all time favorite dish here. The service is fair the first couple times my family and I we're served by a blonde waitress and she seemed a little off. The last time I came here (yesterday) the service was way better. I went w/ my friend and we were served by one of the chefs. He was very pleasant, attentive and smiled. (Smiling is a plus for me) Hands down the best restaurant in Southern Highlands."

For me, South China is in the middle of the pack -- not as fancy as Rainbow Garden or as tasty as Golden Harbor, but somewhere inbetween. The big plus of this restaurant is the spacious interior and decent size parking lot but the dishes are a little on the expensive side and the service could be quicker. Food is inconsistent with some dishes being excellently prepared while others are bland and forgetful. In particular, I liked the Deep Fried Fish Fillet with Pine Nuts & Sweet & Sour Sauce, Sauteed Asparagus & Shredded Pork, Braised Pork, Mao's Family Style, and Stewed Meatball With Brown Sauce in Hot Pot."

Really wishing I had purchased the max # now instead of just one!\nThe mixologists here are superb, and the attention to the detail of each drink rivals or exceeds that of my fave mixology spot DCR. There's really some craftsmanship going on here! The downside to that is that out of about 10 specialty cocktails, only 3 or 4 are vegan-- one has meat, a few have eggwhite, and a couple more have honey. So, that's always disappointing when I can't fully booze it up. \nBut the drinks I could/did try were GREAT! I had the Drunk Monk (gin-based, and I'm not a real fan of gin.... but the gin has tea steeped in it, and it's the tea taste that really comes through), the Spiked Rose (brandy and fruitiness, and all around tasty), and the Hard 8, which is their spruced up version of a Dark n Stormy. This is probably your best bet if you want your drink to last awhile, since it's served on ice, rather than up, like many of the other ones. Which, when they're SO tasty, makes them way too easy to slurp down. \nThe bartenders were very friendly and seemed to understand my vegan concerns. They and the quality of (vegan) drinks are totally 5-star! But the bar itself.... hmmm. It's set up oddly, and really doesn't maximize the space. If you're not sitting at the bar, you end up standing against the wall or sitting in a way that's not conducive to conversation for more than two or three people. Plus the music was way too loud. \nI'm hoping to return soon for a happy hour to take advantage of their specials (custom cocktails only $7!) and hopefully to have a more quiet setting to enjoy said cocktails.\nRegardless, this is definitely a must-do spot on a tour of downtown! Especially when the weather gets warm and they open up the outdoor seating!"

It's a long LONG walk, even if google makes it look easy it is not. But if you park at NYNY Casino you'll be on Tropicana and it'll be super easy to get to The Strip. \nIt would have been nice to know that the pool was going to be closed during our entire stay prior to booking. They were painting the buildings and the pool area. It SUCKED not having a pool, no matter how small it seemed to be. We were told when we arrived that we could use the other WM timeshares' pool. We ALMOST did but didn't want to have to get all our stuff and drive over there then come back wet or stay until we dried. There were spa's/Jacuzzi within the resort. It was nice but closed at 10pm. We went in after 10pm but had to be VERY quiet and left just in time of the security guard making his rounds. Whew!\nWe used the fitness center (had to equal out the food we were about to eat) had 2 treadmills, 2 ellipticals, a bike machine and one of those weight pully things. It is in the main building where you check-in and play pool. \nThe one bedroom we stayed in was building 5. The rooms were made to look like mini-apartments each separate outside entrance and upper levels have stairs, no elevator because each building had 4-6 rooms only. Towels were provided and with all other kitchen amenities you'd need. The room sleeps 4 using a murphy bed in the living room. The unit also had a balcony with tables and chairs. They also provide you with soap for dishes and detergent for a couple of loads of laundry. There is a stacked washer/dryer in the unit and hangers in the closets. \nI would stay here again.\n-----------5/16/2012 update regarding pool ----------------\nWM contacted hubby and said that there was a notification upon our reservation that there is construction is this resort. I looked at all my paper work and did not find anything stating so. I even went through a booking for this resort just to see if there was anything along the online reserveration process and I still did not see anything. Call ahead to the resort itself to be sure."

    "text": "I have to fall somewhere in the middle on this place. Elie's gets high marks for being a family-run establishment and for having super-friendly and likeable service, but it falls a little short in the food department. \nI can walk to this place from my work, so I decided to do just that one day last week. Alicia B was definitely right when she said that this place is \"dinky\" - the flooring is old, the tables are dingy, the bathroom is passable, and the \"decor\" consists of a few potted plants and some framed stock pictures of Greece. I might forgive the extreme lack of atmosphere if I felt that the prices were reasonable, since that would mean that the owners were skimping on style in order to provide a high-quality product. \nUnfortunately, the food doesn't quite deliver, especially given the high prices. I really wanted to order one of the vegetarian combo plates, but the cheapest one with falafel (plus hummus) was $7.85! That is really steep, in my opinion. If I had wanted to add baba and tabouli, it would have run me $9.10. Because this felt high, I ended up getting the falafel sandwich for $5.59. It only came with lettuce, tomatoes, and tahini sauce, so I ended up adding green peppers for $.45 (a bargain compared to the $.99 they charge to add tomatoes). \nI waited 10-15 minutes for my food, which I understand given that there was a steady flow of eat-in and take-out customers. When the sandwich did arrive (with a smile from the again very friendly owner), I enjoyed it because I was starving, but again, wasn't all too impressed. The pita was very large but very dry, and it definitely could have stood to be more moist. Similarly, I found the falafel overly dry and crumbly. The tahini sauce was decent but not as subtle as some I've had in the past. \nFor $8 or so, I got a filling falafel sandwich and a large Diet Coke. I definitely prefer the $2.99 falafel sandwich at Al-Hana, although the uber-convenient location of Elie's may mean that I return a few more times. I will definitely update if I go back and try something more on-point."

I found out about it very recently and I vow to come here as often as possible. \nIt's pretty ridiculous to have a restaurant this good open only during late nights, i mean that to me is such a tease. But that's what makes this place extra special. I don't even know where to start on how great this place can be for the human species in Montreal, QC. \nThis place seems like a fast food joint you go to when you are not sober and craving some junk food. But I will tell you this place is much much more. Calling Centrale Bregham a \"fast food joint\" does not give the place one molecule of justice. \nFirst of all their staff is ridiculously nice, everyone I ordered from were very helpful in identifying what I would like and they are all very patient with customers. The price is also very fair compared to other Montreal fast food joints. \nI personally came here sober at least twice and thoroughly enjoyed my burgers and sandwhiches. It really doesn't matter what you choose, I truly believe everything on their menu will taste good and be mouth watering. They use a special type of sauce in all of their heavenly creations and any meal you order will fill you up. I mean the food is absolutely unique and different from any other sandwhich place or burger joint you will walk into. In fact, this is my favorite place in Montreal and this is coming from a pretty classy guy that guys to upscale restaurants periodically. \nJust writing this review makes my taste buds tingle and my mouth wetter than it was before I started writing this review. That's how powerful and tasty their food is. So if you come here, ladies and gentleman, bring extra lower body undergarments because this place has food that will make your body experience something pleasant that you will not forget."

That dish was great, but what really shocked us was how delicious the pancakes were! They were so unique too, perfectly cooked and crisp on the edges, they were the best pancakes I have ever had! So flavorful and the texture was perfect, they are huge too...no way we could finish them. Another cool thing was that the owner and chef was there working away! She's done a great job with this place, fun, creative and delicious comfort food at it's finest!\nMY GO-TO DISH: I don't think you can go wrong here, but the pancakes are not to be missed!

Unfortunately things have drastically changed from the last time I was here. To start the minute I walked in with my daughter it took a few minutes from the guy up front to even look up and acknowledge us then he just took off expecting us to follow him to the table without saying anything. Next it took 15 minutes for someone just to come to the table and say hi and take drink orders. I figured it's ok it looked like he was by himself and had a couple of tables I decided to be patient and giving it a chance. After waiting another 5 minutes for a water and a sprite. I finally see the server coming with our drinks but then stops puts the drinks down 5 feet away from me picks up food for the table next to us and just carries on. meanwhile another 10 minutes go by and I'm still just staring at my drinks from a far. Now I see there is another server working. A guy who came in 20 minutes after me gets seated and water within a few minutes and the final straw is when the other server walked by my table and drinks sitting on the counter twice and nothing said or done.

Our larger party was escorted to the second level into one of the private rooms for our meal.\nAs I oft do when somebody else is paying, I quickly gravitated towards the most expensive items on the menu. For this go around, it was the foie-gras appetizer, beef tenderloin (ok this was second most, but I love beets and horseradish). As can be reasonably expected with any foie gras dish, it represented completely over-the-top decadence, and I Ioved every bite of it. Melt in your mouth and the brioche had just enough crunch and texture to complement the rich treat. Tenderloin was also cooked to perfection and SO TENDER I wanted to cry (and probably did a little).

It's a small shop along their faux street where you order at a counter, wait for your food, then hope you can find seating. Our order was up in about 10 minutes and lucked out by grabbing a tiny table to eat at. Between the three of us (2 adults and a kid) 2 crepes were plenty filling.\nSt. Louis ($9.99) - imported ham and mozzarella and fresh basil with bechamel. The description mentioned imported ham. Maybe they meant imported from the local grocery store, because the ham didn't taste any better than what I get at Albertson's. The bechamel sauce was too thin and runny for my liking.\nToulouse ($9.99) - ground sausage, pepperoni, sautéed mushrooms, mozzarella, basil, topped with marinara. This was the better of the two that we ordered. Tasted just like a pizza. The marinara lacked the depth in flavor that would make it special, but was good enough to satisfy.\nThis might be a good place for a quick bite, but definitely not some place that I would seek out or ever crave.

We ordered the Gold package and were told our server would take care of everything once inside the theater.\nOnce we were allowed to enter everyone entered the same door. It wasn't until we were trapped in the line that we realized there was another door on the other side that would have sped up the wait to get into our seat. Maybe if they were both open that might have streamlined seating.\nwe got to our seats, got comfortable (more on that), experimented with the electric recliner and generally got situated. Once our server showed, we ordered. My wife wanted a white wine. The server highly recommended one of their Chardonnays. We learned after tasting that 1) don't take wine recommendations from someone not old enough to drink and 2) iPic doesn't know a quality wine from vinegar. The Chardonnay was easily the worst either one of us had tasted and we didn't finish it. \nWe ordered Chocolate covered strawberries and the Oreo Ice cream sandwich. Our server didn't know they were out of the ice cream sandwich and told us when she delivered the strawberries. Probably a good thing since that probably prevented another food abortion. The chocolate covered strawberries were also horrible and unripe. My bet is, they're not made on premises but charge as if they were. After just eating at Tanzy, I wrongly assumed the menu would be similar since I believe they're owned by the same. Menu was not great..at least the dessert menu with it's three options. The other option was a Berries Sabayon which the server tried to push after our two previous dessert failures. \nNot long into the movie my wife noticed her 3D glasses were dirty. It took about 30 minutes before we saw our \"server\" again to ask for another pair. The second pair was better but not much. They reuse glasses and the high school kids working there probably aren't too into cleaning them well.\nComfort. I was all set for a nice comfortable recliner. Not. There is a metal bar running across the middle of the back of the recliner that will be guaranteed to let you know it's there by the middle of the movie. I spent the second half of the movie trying to avoid the bar to no success. The only way I was able to minimize the bar in the back was with the foot rest down which kind of defeats the point of a recliner. Since your feet won't touch the ground (and I'm 6'1\"), that is an uncomfortable feeling as well.\nWhile the concept is fantastic, the designers and operators really ignored the details. If you build it, they will come is not a good business model. They may come.....once. And once it will be. We will not be back."

I have taken a few of these on for them from Los Angeles (the least of which was Home Depot, who eventually made good on the $500 issue) because they are simply not tech savvy enough - although they are intelligent - to maneuver today's complex digital business world when things go wrong - they've been retired for 20+ years.So I was grateful when they used Rakeman's for a couple of bigger plumbing jobs on their house and they seemed satisfied and felt the pricing was fair. \nThen recently, they had a toilet issue, so they dropped into Rakeman's to ask if it was something they could help them to fix. To my amazement, one of the Rakeman workers went to my parent's house and fixed the toilet for FREE. This just does not happen in most places. \nPlease support this extremely decent business - who does good work at a fair price - and values human beings over hourly billings. It meant the world to my folks and to me for them to be treated so well."

He recommended two crowns and before you knew it I was out $1600 after insurance! At least he gave me some pain pills.\nA month later I get the same pain, sharp pains molars, I go back for an emergency visit, and the dentist says I cracked the third tooth behind it which may have got infected? I said that was probably his fault when he removed the first two teeth and he proceeds to tell me I need a root canal and third crown. Luckily the root canal was successful and I return to get the permanent crown with more pain pills. He nicely said he'd only make me pay half of the third crown to keep my as his customer.\nIt's been six months, I have three crowns, a root canal and the pain has returned. My tooth is now super sensitive to cold (to the point where even brushing my teeth hurts). I will not be returning to this office and have moved my primary care elsewhere. It's too bad because my schedules where on time and his location is great. I say in person Dr. Dunn is really nice, but I'm flat out broke from spending money on my teeth and I cannot afford another one of his mistakes."

They have a good variety to choose from and it's all made to order. The quality of the fish was decent but pales in comparison to a regular pay-as-you-go sushi bar. Some of the pieces had warm rice! There's also an assortment of rolls to choose from such as the spider roll and salmon skin roll. Beware... the rolls are huge! \nSome of the items are one-order-per such as the Sweet Shrimp and the Sea Urchin. But they also have a bunch of other none sushi stuff that's all you can eat such as the miso soup, green tea ice cream and shu mai. \nThe place is small but can still accommodate a couple of large groups. A real cozy feel with waiters watching you to make sure you don't waste food. They were quick to respond and take additional orders.\nOverall you get what you paid for and for $27.00 (dinner) I can see myself coming back for more. Just don't expect the best quality."

First of all, she paid attention to what I had grabbed and brought in the same style dress as the one I had came in to the store for. The dress she brought was a better pattern and wasn't as causal as the dress I selected. Second, she listened to the event I was going to and the dress code requirements. Third, she told me the truth about the way the dress looked. Lastly, she wasn't pressuring me to buy anything I didn't need. I ended up buying 3 times the amount of things I had planned on and it was all because of how pleasant and helpful the sales associate was.\nI can't wait to go back to shop there.

    "text": "The positives about staying at the Flamingo? \n1. You're on a budget and don't plan to stay in your room very much \n2. Location (fairly central on the Strip and easy access to other hotels- Paris hotel is right next to it and Caesar's is across the street) \nThe negatives: \n1. Parking- not very obvious entrance, we had to consult a friend to figure out where to go and ended up entering on some random backstreet behind the hotel. It was probably because we got there around 10 on a Friday night, but finding parking was pretty much impossible until circling for 15 minutes and finding literally the last corner spot in the lot. \n2. Hotel service- we had several hiccups with our room, which had all of the basics; I was expecting a dirty old run-down carpet, but instead we had hardwood which was a slight upgrade. But re-directing, one of the most egregious issues we dealt with was when our toilet ended up overflowing. We made a call to the front desk the second the issue arose and the individual at the front desk said they would send someone to take care of it. An hour later, we called again to say that no-one had come to service the toilet, and the front desk responded that they would submit a service request to maintenance. We wanted to get our day going and left for a few hours only to return back to the room with still an unfixed toilet (SERIOUSLY?) We made a third call down to the frontdesk and they responded as if we were highly inconviencing them and they were unaware of the status of our service request... eventually after some more prodding someone eventually came to fix it, but the amount of effort and lack of responsiveness was just unfathomable. Several other instances during our visit we had requested items from the front desk (toiletries, etc) and none of it ever got delivered. They did give us a lot of towels though. \n3. Some of the renovations around the hotel are kind of tacky-- the women's restroom behind the buffet literally had a sign made of cardboard and a piece of tape stuck to the wall with \"Women\" written on it in sharpie."

Rao's in NY has some sort of crazy reservation system in which it's a two year wait list so the one In Vegas is your only shot without a reservation.\nWhen we went there my girlfriend and I were greeted by this nice older dude who I presume was the manager siting in the corner taking a break (I think). We were seated quickly and had good service throughout the meal.\nI have tried different chicken parmigiana, but have never found one I liked. When I saw on the menu that Rao's had Veal Parmigiana (I've heard that's how it's traditionally made) I had to try. The idea of breading and frying something, then covering it with melted mozzarella cheese and marinara sauce sounds so delicious to me, but I have just come to accept that it's just not for me. Nothing wrong with the meat itself, in fact I was surprised at how big the portion was, I just find this dish is always to salty for me, no matter which restaurant I try it at. One thing about Rao's Parmigiana dish is that it does not come with a side of pasta, all you get is the veal (huge bummer). My girlfriend had the pasta shells with, I believe was, ricotta and marinara sauce. It was really good and I wished I had gotten that instead. \n The reason I give this place 4 instead of 5 stars is because while the food is delicious and is some of the better Italian fair that I have ever had, it did not blow my mind like I had hoped it would or how Food Network's \"Throwdown with Bobby Flay\" portrayed it as the holy grail of Italian food. If I am ever near the Las Vegas area again though, I will surely give this place another shot."

    "text": "You've got to hand it to Candace Nelson; she knows how to bake up palpable buzz. You need look no further than the perpetual line at Sprinkles Cupcakes in Scottsdale. If only the cupcakes were as good as the hype. Unfortunately, they are not.\nIt comes down to style over substance. Sprinkles Cupcakes has a great look from the windows frosted with the outlines of cupcake wrappers to the spare wood display racks. The aesthetic is clean, modern and restrained. The cupcakes are impeccable in terms of their appearance. The bakery even offers an interlocking cardboard stand with optional ribbon trim to create a display for a special event. The graphics and design are top-notch. \nWhile we may eat with our eyes first, the disappointment creeps in once you move beyond the visual and taste the cupcakes. At best, they're okay. In order to give Sprinkles a fair shake, I pre-ordered a dozen online. Anyone can order a minimum of a dozen cupcakes online with 24 hours advance notice. The real advantage of the pre-order is that you get to skip the mayhem of the line. It's worth it to walk right up to the counter and pick up your prepaid order without having to stand in the chaotic line and watch the crowd's tension level rise as they run out of flavor after flavor. \nAs a home baker who makes everything from scratch, I found Sprinkles Cupcakes to be resoundingly underwhelming. Their signature Red Velvet Cake was a real disappointment. The cake itself was bitter and sour at the same time. It also had an unpleasant lingering aftertaste. Actually, all of the cupcakes I tried with chocolate cake had the same bitter and sour taste combined with the lingering unpleasant aftertaste. It was almost like the chocolate cakes weren't mixed properly before they were baked. If it has been one or two cupcakes, I would have given them the benefit of the doubt; however, this place takes the concept of bittersweet chocolate to a new and very strange level. The Carrot cupcake is also misnamed; it should be called a Spice cupcake instead because the presence of any carrot is nearly undetectable. In fairness, the Coconut cupcake was the best of the 12 sampled. The taste of both the cake and the icing was great; the cake itself was a bit stiff and dry (but less than the others sampled). \nIn terms of texture, the 12 cupcakes sampled varied from \"sturdy\" (e.g., nothing close to tender) to dry and crumbling apart. This is definitely not what I expect from a premium bakery. Some other reviewers have commented that the cupcakes are too expensive. Clearly they haven't been to a grocery store lately to check on the price of butter, eggs, sugar, cream, cream cheese, etc. The cupcakes are fairly priced for the premium ingredients that Sprinkles uses. However, those ingredients are not falling into the most adept hands. Perhaps this is an issue with a newly trained staff. \nFor the money and the pleasure of the experience, enjoy an Ooey Gooey from Tammie Coe instead of Sprinkles. Tammie's cupcakes are the real deal and are everything that Sprinkles aspires to be. Just be sure to allow Tammie's cupcakes to return to room temperature before you devour them. They're sublime while the cupcakes at Sprinkles are serviceable at best.\nSprinkles Cupcakes was worth trying once to see what all the hype was about. However, I won't be back."

I remember a campus that had comprised of one building with a courtyard, and now it has grown to campus with a couple buildings throughout. This community college outfit is the lesser campus compared to Mesa Community on Southern Ave. Nevertheless, it provides the same classes offered, and in my opinion the classes are smaller. I like the fact that parking at CGC is not that tough compared to MCC. \nI feel the staff at CGC are quite friendly and a little more helpful. I was at CGC recently for a Microsoft certification test. I was happy to hear that their computer lab was open till 10 pm and someone was able to proctor the exam later than the lab at MCC. So kudos to them. So, if I ever need to take other classes at CGC I totally recommend this campus."

Decided to finally visit Sora this past Friday and had been extremely intrigued by all the yelpers who prefer Sora over Monta and vice versa. I actually convinced myself that Sora probably had better Ramen because even though I love Monta's version, I've sort of gotten bored of it and find myself ordering the Pork Belly Bowl more often. \nDecided to go with the Spicy Miso bowl and was also fortunate enough to be able to try the Shoyu Ramen as well. I really liked the noodles at Sora, moreso than Monta as I felt they were more al dente than what I've had at Monta which is what I prefer. The pork and egg gave me the same pleasurable dining experience that I get from Monta. As for the broth, in the beginning I actually thought it was a little bland, even after I tried to mix it all up. With each bite, it became better and better and by the end of my bowl, I felt it had a lot of depth. The next time I go I actually think I'm going to hold off a few minutes before digging right in as difficult as that will be to do. The longer those ingredients, and in particular the spicy ground pork, stew in the broth, the better. I think overall I found it to be as enjoyable as my favorite broth at Monta, the tonkatsu.\nI also tried some of the Shoyu broth and actually wasn't impressed with it. I thought it tasted fairly thin and not nearly as flavorful as Monta's version. I do need to explore their side offerings some more before trying to break this tie, but for now it is what it is. To the owners of Monta and Sora: I accept bribes (to the Yelp Elite Council: just kidding)"

We had to take a couple elevators and a moving walkway to get there. Probably not good for drunken nights. I could totally see people getting lost!! \nGood selection in their food court. \nI would consider staying here again if the price was right, but I prefer the strip."

When our waiter came to check on us, I told him about the mozzarella sticks. His response,\"Oh. Uh. Uh. Do you want me to take these back?\" It was really hard to notice his disgust and sarcasm in his response. We already ordered a pizza, which we were told would take 45 minutes, so we waited in hopes of it being delicious. When he brought it to us 45 minutes later, it was cold ...and just gross. Another notable observation; The waiter NEVER CAME BACK TO OUR TABLE. Not to check on us. Not to refill drinks. Nothing. We had to go to the hostess stand to get our bill. The food was just awful, as was the customer service. Believe me, we will never come back."

It costs more here than the same order at the Fashion Mall location, I believe.\n- Never very crowded\nCons:\n- Pricey!

You will need to flag them down for a refill of tea. Went there last night and waited 15 min before the guy came and took my order. \n- Again, Pricey for what you get! Our tab was more than $86 for dinner /tea/desserts(I had a wrap and tea and dessert) - we did not have any appetizers. Imagine if we would have had good service, the bill would have been higher due to higher tip! LOL!\n- Not many table tops that will hold 4+ people -- I think maybe 6-7 total.\nWe made our mind up last night, after the consistent bad service and high tab for an average meal that we won't go back there again except for desserts and that will be \"to go\"...\nThe owner/chef is there a lot - I don't know why she doesn't notice that her wait-staff is horrible and killing her business. She also needs to lower her prices by 10-15%...She should read these reviews or at least have a suggestion box at her register..."

Since they have 2 areas for music, they should switch it up and tailor to everyone's likes. Not everyone likes house, trance, hipster, and high energy. Some people like to hear some top 40 and hip hop. Play some! The music inside gives me a headache, especially since the big speakers are right on the dancefloor!\nYelp Challenge!

Table service is efficient, but can be cool. \nDinner entrees and specials lean pricey, so I usually go for a green chile burger with a side of Azteca soup. Conventional, but both elements are sizable, delicious and a relative steal at $11. The burger is a half pound of chuck, well dressed with a spongy roll. The soup is a spicy chicken tortilla variation with some subtle hints. It's a satisfying plate for about the cost of my wife's 4 oz glass of vino. \nIf they had interesting beer on draught, like a really nice IPA, and more charming servers, this might be five star territory.\np.s. - sunday brunch is not a buffet, but the menu's inventive, elegant and delicious.

My dad took the fam to Pinot Brasserie on a Saturday night at 8pm - I thought the place would be crowded, but it was pretty quiet. It was convenient since we were staying at the Venetian. The service was extremely attentive (thanks Steven) and the food we had was good, but I will warn you, it's a pretty limited menu.\nI went with a mixed green salad that had fresh citrus and some grilled asparagus on it... and then I had 6 oysters on the half shell and a side of creamed spinach. This was a really good meal along with the fresh roll they served and a nice glass of Sauv Blanc. The rest of the fam enjoyed other apps and entrees including the Caesar Salad, Scallop Nicoise, Mussels, and Escargot. Although portions were not huge, our choices kept us satisfied through the (Chris Rock) show we went to see after our meal.\nAgain, Pinot Brasserie was pleasant, but I would recommend only to those who are fans of French food - take a look at the menu before you choose Pinot Brasserie as one of your dining destinations while in Vegas!"

Secondly, I've become somewhat addicted to their wings ever since being invited here a couple of times on somebody else's dollar. They're really perfectly seasoned with just enough peppery heat. Mind you, this is not my favorite place in Phoenix for hot wings when I am on that mission, but these are a very compelling appetizer.\nI was pleasantly surprised to discover they offer a 10%-off discount if you check in through Yelp on your mobile phone. They already had me at Happy Hour drink and appetizer discounts, but another break on the price is always welcome.\nConsider checking out 1130 if you're catching a movie at the cinemas in the Arizona Center. You could always go for a plate of wings instead of a movie theater hot dog, couldn't you? I know I could."

Inside the place looked cool, with the old school tv and what not, the benches are a lil uncomfortable but they provide you with pillows to sit your bum on. \nWe were served our doggy dishes for the tea right away, but it took another 20-25 minutes for the server to come back and even take our order. The place wasn't packed and it seemed like everyone there was just \"hanging\" out. Well when we finally got to order the server told me that they didn't have my oxtail noodle soup....so I ordered this short rib soup. The food came out probably about 10-15 minutes later which is about average I think. My \"soup\" was good. The meat was tender for the most part, but there were no noodles. I really wanted something with noodles and the server said this was what replaced the oxtail noodle soup. The rest of my friends enjoyed their meal for the most part. \nMaybe I was just there at the wrong time and didn't order the right thing, but I was not impressed. \nService really was terrible and I think that ruined the whole Soyo experience for me. I'm a huge sucker for service and when there is no service or lack of service I become this mad woman. When our check came, the server had given us the wrong one. The one she gave us was for an amount WAY cheaper with a discount (about 10-15%) on it, luckily for her I went up to her and said that it was the wrong check. She printed the right check and there was no discount. I wonder how one gets such an awesome discount. In any case for 6 of us, the bill came out to be around 85 something bucks plus tip...which was about right for 5 entrees and 3 soju bombs.

Walking in they opened the door for me and later in the meal they even gave me a few free shots. When someone offers me free shots they've made a new friend! Plenty of parking, and the restaurant has a nice open feeling to it.\nThe food was oh so delicious, and described very nicely by Chad E. The portions were small but they brought out tons of them and there ended up being way more than enough for everyone! The cheese plate had a nice variety of interesting cheeses, my favorite being the mild and super fresh tasting Brie. I was a fan of the pork on pork, but then again anything wrapped in bacon is pretty tasty to me. Not so much a fan of the sweet potato gnocchi because the texture was a bit off putting to me and reminded me of a boiled plantain. The chocolate panna cotta? Contrary to popular belief I only had 2! Those things are so delicious though I could probably have just eaten those the whole time.\nThe drink specials were really popular and tasty. I got to try out every single cocktail at the CMYE and there wasn't one I didn't like. The basil infused tomato martini was savory and earthy, while the cucumber lemon martini was bright and refreshing. The others were supremely fruity and perfect for a hot day. My favorite was the strawberry mojito that Faith recommended. It's like a strawberry starburst for adults! And they even make some of the drinks in shot form as I found out later when I got offered some free shots from the nice people working there!\nThis is a fabulous place that I'm going to have to try out again soon. Also I need more chocolate panna cotta."

Almost everyone who was here was in work out clothes haha. \nI tried the Margherita pizza and the Green Leaf Berry Blast. \nThe Margherita pizza was simple but delicious. It was a thin crust pizza with tomato sauce, low-fat mozzarella cheese and slices of tomato with bits of basil garnishing. I wish I had gotten the gluten free version though! - I really love how they have the gluten free option. The portion was probably good for sharing with one other person. \nThe smoothie was alright. The taste was leaning more towards the spinach and kale which I wasn't really fond of. I do love kale though but it was probably the spinach that was giving it a weird flavor. I'd give it a 3/5. \nThere was also complimentary cucumber water which was a refreshing touch. The place itself is pretty spacious and busy but the service was fast and the workers were very nice. I'm glad that this place is close by my neighborhood. I will definitely stop by again to try the other foods. They also have an ostrich burger which I don't think I'll be trying anytime soon lol."

Good tea selection too. Never had the food, but it looks swell.\nCan't say I care much for the service. It's not incompetent or rude, but it's astoundingly apathetic. Strictly functional.

We had a few questions about different menu items and he was very informative and helpful! Plus he had a great quirky personality that makes him a great waiter!\nSince it was Happy Hour, they have many 1/2 price appetizers and deals on drinks. We decided to split the Chicken Nachos and Bearnaise Sliders. This was a fantastic deal as our nachos ended up only being about 5.50 and the sliders were around 6.50. The chicken nachos were delivered on a huge plate! This plate alone would have actually been enough for both of our stomachs to be filled. They had a great combination of ingredients with plenty of chicken spread throughout the nachos. Fabulous! \nThe sliders came out with 4 on the plate and a side of shoestring fries. I didn't see that fries were included so that was a bonus. Plus I love shoestring style french fries. Yum. The sliders were just ok. I almost wish we ordered the classic style sliders. Yes I did love the bearnaise sauce that accompanied the sliders on the side but the burger itself was very plain. It still enjoyed them. \nTheir dining area itself is spacious and roomy. There are plenty of seating inside and on their outdoor patio. Everything was kept very clean and tidy! It doesn't hurt to see their keg room when you first walk in... puts a smile on my husbands face! It is a great place whether you are visiting or a local."

The soup dumplings were good, I loved having the vinegar on the table and not feeling rushed( a feeling I got back in NYC at Joe's Shanghai(the best soup dumplings I have had so far)). The crispy beef was sweet and crunchy, and was also suggested in the Weekly review. We ordered a Hot and Sour Soup that was tangy and filled with all sorts of goodies( ask for the small bowl to feed 3 or more...The large must be able to feed an army). The waiter suggested we try the scallion pancake next time...and we shall return to do just that.\nThe jasmine tea was beautiful, aromatic and not too strong.\nThe waiter was thoughtful and very experienced. We enjoyed our late night meal there, and will be back."

So we picked Japonais because my Dad was craving Japanese and we all agreed to have some fresh sushi. \nThis restaurant is located right by the Mirage Atrium, Fin, and the Cravings Buffet. It's design was very hip and trendy and that's what the Mirage was transforming into from it's glory days as the most luxurious hotel ('89) to just an average joe hotel. \nBut anyways, we ordered the Signature Platter, good for 4 - 5 people and came with fresh fish; Tuna, Salmon, White Fish, Mackerel, Halibut, Shrimp, Squid, and Inagi. We also ordered miso soup and edamame as our appetizers. The food was terrific and didn't disappoint as well as the service being top notch. Sitting in the lounge area was just relaxing, having a flat screen TV with the game playing or laying back on the soft leather seat and admiring the Mirage Atrium. \nThey won be as a return customer for it's hip and trendy settings and savory food and I'll be back to try more on their menu and some cocktails."

My two favorite things here are the free Fountains show choreographed to different types of music and themes- Pink Panther, Andrea Bocelli, Frank Sinatra (show times below) and the also free, Conservatory & Botanical Gardens- we came here to take pictures after our wedding (it's such a fun memory and we've got the pictures to prove it). It's an amazing display of the beauty of flowers, done in several scenes- there is an ample amount of photo spots here. The floral smells are amazing, as well. There is a small bridge with a water feature. It's crowded here, so be warned. \nSHOW TIMES:\nMonday - Friday\n3:00 p.m. - 7:00 p.m.\nshow every 1/2 hour\n7:00 p.m. - 12:00 a.m.\nshow every 15 minutes\nSaturdays, Sundays* and Holidays\n12:00 p.m. - 7:00 p.m.\nshow every 1/2 hour\n7:00 p.m. - 12:00 a.m.\nshow every 15 minutes\nThe decor is Italian/European styling- the architectural details are all over. Also notable, is the Fiori Di Como, a glass sculpture on the ceiling, composed of 2000 hand-blown blooms in bright vibrant colors, blue, red, yellow, green, etc. There is always fresh flowers in the lobby. For hotel guests, the amenities include: spa/salon, fitness room, pool. Shopping here are strictly high-end labels such as Bottega Venetta, Omega, Chanel, Dior, Fendi, Tiffany, Giorgio Armani, Gucci, Hermes, Louis Vuitton, and Prada. (Ok, not really practical for the average person on a budget.) The resident show is \"O\" by Cirque Du Soleil- ticket prices are $155/$130/$109/$98.50 (limited views)- wednesdays through sundays, 7:30 pm and 10 pm. And finally, the Gallery of Fine Art, open from 10 am to 8 pm (last entry is at 7:30 pm), $15 for visitors, $12 for those with NV ID. Special Locals Promotion on wednesdays from 5 pm to 7:30 pm only: $8 entry with NV ID. (If you're entering from outside, not the parking lot, there is a small concession stand, if you're thirsty or if you want a light snack.)\nI bet that if you are a local, you've been here at least once before, because there are free attractions (there are a few that are worth going to) here and your out-of-town family members wanted to come and see it. It's a pretty casino/hotel on The Strip with free parking, so what have you got to lose?"

I took my dog to this clinic and I was asked to take my other dog out of the waiting room while we were taking our second dog for his neuter. This was okay since my dog was acting out. But when I returned to get my dog I was told he wasn't ready and I asked politely if I could use the restroom and was denied that right and told to go to another business up the street. That they had two bathrooms and had some rescues in one bathroom and the private other bathroom I wouldn't be allowed to use. I find this very rude since I paid them in advance and denied bathroom access? How accommodating is this. I right there flat out told the receptionist she was rude. And she was really RUDE. I met the doctor and she was the only one nice. But the receptionist was a horror story in itself! I noticed when we first arrived. No nice greeting. Welcome Nothing! And felt like a number. No customer service and asked to take my dog out by this guard there. And just not a very pleasant first impression with the front reception desk. Like we are doing you a favor and we could care less to be nice to you attitude. I've ran a limousine service for over 20 years and I would not allow my front desk to give people a snotty impression. Especially at my front desk. I would never return. I was going to do all shots and when I got this nasty attitude. I only did the rabies and neuter. Figured I would do the rest of the shots somewhere that treats their customers with RESPECT and gratitude then deny you a bathroom as if your a robber or something. I gave the receptionist a piece of free ADVICE. No CHARGE. Your RUDE!\nShe immediately went back to get my dog to get me out of there. She's lucky she did that. Oh and my dog got a free blanket which they didn't do for anyone else. I guess my little girl asked them for it. And we got special attention above the rest. I give them one star not to bash put maybe they should consider a more pleasant reception girl at the front desk who is courteous and polite. The person at the front desk is the first impression of a business. And if she was overly nasty with a bad attitude. I wouldn't of wrote all this. Mind you we had a great day spending at the casinos with our dog who wasn't asked to leave before going to this place to pick up our dog. So we were not in a negative mode or state till she started with the nasty attitude. We don't allow people like this our business so we will do our shots somewhere more pleasant and appreciative of their customers. I just fail to see how you are denied a bathroom after all the money we paid and told to take your other dog out and no we don't have a bathroom!"

I had the chance of speaking with some very accurate readers here at this store and some readers who were only good with card readings. I am using this forum mostly to complain about one reader who used to be a favorite of mine for over a year until she felt she was fail proof and said something completely out of character with my best friend that was simply untrue.\nLisa Jo had warned me about a few people in my immediate circle of friends and my business associates but sometimes I felt her readings were a bit hysterical simply to keep me enthralled so I would feel a need to continue on with the reading (and hence pay a bit more than I intended).\nDon't get me wrong. Lisa Jo came across as being very sincere in her efforts to watch out for my best interests but as time went on I felt the readings were continuing on a negative path making me leaving the conversation a bit paranoid and confused. One day I corrected Lisa Jo and told her something she said was completely off so she got very disturbed on the phone and rather than apologize to me she became haughty and angry that I would challenge her thought and make note of something that was incorrect in her analysis. On a whole I felt her readings could give me insight but the fact that she refused to see my viewpoint and seemed to think she is infallible and correct 100 percent of the time is a cause of concern. As a psychic healer myself I sometimes get an incorrect perception and I always welcome constructive criticisms so I can enhance my abilities as a healer; but the fact that Lisa Jo is unwilling to grow and truly re examine a reading as perhaps being a bit inaccurate is a clear sign that Vision Quest might have a need for better customer relations since phone readings and in store readings can be expensive. A couple of weeks ago I requested a reading with Lisa Jo despite our disagreement but I was refused and even though I wanted to share with Lisa Jo that indeed she was wrong but that part of her other reading did indeed come true I was encouraged to speak to another reader rather than Lisa Jo and not given the opportunity to let Lisa Jo what had happened during a crisis situation. Psychics are just ordinary people with a gift and sometimes if that gift is abused we can lose our ability to really connect with Source and our readings might not be as accurate or as healing as we would like. I think Lisa Jo needs to take her ego in check and I think Vision Quest should do a better job of customer service relations so as not to hurt the general public or allow their readers to abuse customers at their whim."

Both times I had an appointment. \nI setup an appointment last week via their website and Robert replied quickly and we setup a 1pm time for the day I requested. Upon arrival, they had no record of my appointment but seemed okay to work me in. I wasn't offered any water like other's experienced but I knew where it was at from the last time since I was there two hours, and became REAL familiar with the waiting area. I received the wifi password from the woman at the front and I settled in. I honestly thought the last time was a fluke and hoped they could have me in and out since I had some place to be. \nLuckily I had my iPad with me this time and was able to browse the internet and generally entertain myself. The waiting area is nice enough though and they have a case full of unlimited cold water and granola bars and other snacks to hold you over. Unfortunately when I got bored, the only thing on the TV was a soap opera...with no remote to turn the channel. Talk about torture. It was about that time that I realized that I had been there an hour and a half!! At 2:30 I walked over to the front and was told my car was done and that it was being washed. Fine. It needed to be washed and since I waited this long, I might as well get it for free (though I'm pretty sure they get their money with a $50 oil change). I sat back down and another 20 minutes go by. I walk up to the front and see my car sitting in the parking lot. I walk out thinking it's ready and realize that it's IN LINE for the car wash. At that point I'm really irritated and tell them that I want my car and to skip the wash. They promptly pull it over and I go into pay. I'm pretty sure they could tell I was irritated and tried to make excuses for the long delay by telling me that I arrived 'around the lunch hour and some people were gone'. Are you kidding me?? Do you have one person working back there? Who's managing this place?! \nMy service advisor comes around about that time and gives me my bill and tells me that I'll need new tires on my next visit. Thanks! I explain to him my dissatisfaction and he tells me that the 'car wash area needs some definite improvement'. You think? Because I'd say so! Luckily I had a $10 off coupon from their website but I'm still peeved to pay for dealer services and not get the service that goes along with it. I'm familiar with the car business and their bonuses. You'd think they'd be bending over backwards to get great surveys. I definitely won't be returning to this dealership again. The only reason it gets two stars is because of the snacks in the waiting room and the ease of making an appointment."

Although it was made from a darker roux than I have previously had, it was still delicious with a lot of andouille in the mix. I also got a taste of the grilled salmon and fried catfish and found them to be very good. \nDessert-wise, I can say with all honesty that the Jack Daniels praline sauce that comes with the bread pudding is one of the tastiest confections I have ever had and if I had not been in public and surrounded by 7 of my closest friends and 30 strangers, I would have probably drank the rest of it and licked the plate clean. \nThe jambalaya also looked very appetizing and the po' boys menu has piqued my curiosity. I will be returning in the future that's for sure.\nJust a word of warning though, Lola's has a higher-end/gourmet style of presentation so if the only experience you have with Cajun/Creole is the pan roasts at Big Al's, you may find the portions to be a bit lighter than what you're used to. However, you will be more than compensated by the quality of the food, ambiance of the restaurant, and the friendliness of the staff."

There's a hole in the wall ready and willing to serve your drunk behind! \nThe pizzeria is literally a hole in the wall. Located right next to the billiard table and chairs, which is coincidentally outside of the exit of Marquee. There are no signs, so just take a chance going down a long hallway covered with photos of old celebrities, news papers and magazines.\nI love that you can pretty much customize your pizza on the spot. They have generic ones out, but they also have toppings on hand that you can add to your pizza! I personally like the Pepperoni, Bacon, Green Peppers medley. Of course, adding toppings will raise the cost...how much, I really can't say because I've ordered blindly the last few times I've been.\nOverall, great niche in the Cosmopolitan that won't cost you an arm and a leg, and tastes pretty darn good! Bonus points for having TWO pinball machines! ;]"

Veggies and Fruits, Sodas,....I can go on and on. \nOHHH..and dishware, pots, pans, giant ones, containers, - the biggest wok I've ever seen. \nYOU MUST GO CHECK IT OUT.\nThe only thing about shopping here which was a surprise is when I got to the checkstand- it cost $10 for membership/year or pay I think 5% over the marked price. So I paid it- no big deal...it just means I am going to have to shop there more. \nTo go there...you need to go in the morning otherwise you will not have enough time to see everything. They closed earlier than most places and we got the 15-minute warning to get your SH** together. LOL. \nIt's like going to Disneyland...you need more than one day to check out everything. \nExpect the place to be semi-unorganized. --and definitely have some shopping cart etiquette cuz the aisles will not fit two shopping carts to go through at a time. \nIt's not too far from my house and happy that it's not in the middle of Chinatown."

Great selection of local and gourmet mustards, salsas , sauces, and spice mixes, along with some nice cookware at reasonable prices.\nThe location is a bit hidden and the patios somewhat awkward.

I was introduced to this place in Dallas many years ago and was quickly addicted to their always moist cake with rich cream cheese frosting. It doesn't seem to matter the flavor or size, I've tried them all, the product is always good. You can get various sized cakes, bundlets (which are like really big cupcakes) or bundtinis (like little cupcakes) all with their signature frosting. They keep it simple, which I believe helps maintain the consistency across their different stores. \nMy personal favorites are the cinnamon swirl and red velvet, however, I tried the pineapple upside down bundtini today and it's a new contender... \nI have heard they deliver, although I've never tried this service myself, but if you happen to stop by one of their quaint shops you'll find an array of adorable cake/baking themed accessories. They also make great bundt cake bouquets for birthdays, showers, etc. that come complete with flowers or balloons. My sister got one for her birthday and it was insanely cute. \nOverall, I would definitely recommend any of the Nothing Budnt Cake locations if you're looking for a sweet treat.

Our waitress recommended it, and I'm so glad she did. Imagine a cross between popcorn chicken and fried calamari with a spicy aioli dipping sauce: that's what the alligator was like.\nWe also loved our entrees, but be warned, they are gigantic portions. I got the cajun pork chop, which was easily enough for two meals, and my husband got the scallops mac daddy, which looked like two pounds of homemade gourmet mac n cheese. Flavors were great, and I loved the little bit of spicy kick in everything.\nNOLA also has a sizeable specialty drink list, so we tried a few New Orleans-inspired cocktails from that. They were healthy pours, and a decent price. I'm not much of a bourbon drinker, but their Bourbon Street Blues cocktail was pretty good.\nFinally, you have to spring for dessert, and you have to get the beignets. They're like a donut and a funnel cake all in one, loaded with powdered sugar, and served alongside a trio of yummy sherbets. I mean it: no matter how much you eat beforehand, save room for this dessert!\nNOLA also hosts live music and special events (like an upcoming Mardi Gras celebration). They're located in Market Square, but they also have free valet parking if it's crowded and you can't find a spot for your car. We loved it, and we'll definitely be back (for more alligator)."

They are well staffed and speedy.\nI got their spicy chickpea lettuce wrap, which was chickpea, avocado, and sundried tomato on lettuce wraps since I was craving something filling, but healthy and not too heavy for my slightly upset tummy. Was very pleased with the size of it for the price, especially since it came with a little fruit salad! Cost me right around $8. \nWhile waiting, I eyed other people's pizzas, burgers and fries, and baked goodies. All quality items!!

The carpet could use a thorough cleaning and although the linens were \"clean\" they did have stains that made you wonder just how clean they were. No matter how many times they changed the sheets, each one had stain somewhere. \nAt any rate, it is a decent hotel and even though there is a $15 resort fee, at least it also includes the cardio room, free wireless internet and two free drink tickets.

I went with two buddies and we pre-purchased tickets online for ~$38, knowing about our gender disadvantage. Arrived at about 10:45 and got in a little less than an hour later. Definitely helps to have a promoter but it seemed that they were just letting groups with girls in as long as their ratios were 1:1 or better. \nThe last time I went to XS they had only opened a small portion of the outdoor area, basically just some of the tables outside behind where the DJ was. Even this area was closed off this time around. I'm not sure how accurate I am about this, but it seemed even that Surrender is having larger crowds than XS nowadays. I know one reason why sections of clubs are closed off is because they don't expect as much people but they still want to make the club seem crowded. Whether or not this was the reason this past weekend I'm not sure.\nAnyway I really like the vibe of XS. The music was awesome after Sultan and Ned Shepard came on. Before that at around 11:30-12:30 it was pretty good too, but you could kind of tell the DJ was asked either to withhold from playing certain songs or to lame it down a little before Sultan and Ned Shepard. Either way when they came on at 1:00 AM everyone had a really good time. \nDrinks are more expensive here than at TAO, which I went to on Friday night. Hennessy and OJ (which was my drink of the weekend) was running at $15 at TAO and $17 at XS. Not that big of a difference, but it does start racking up.\nThere wasn't much of a line for the men's bathroom both times that I visited. \nXS will still remain on my list of recommendable clubs, even with new contenders like Hakkassan and Light. In the end it's more important who's performing, what kind of music you like, and who you're with. For me, XS on 11/30 was all I could ask for.\ntl;dr - yes."

Most CA locations are closed now, so I've only heard the stories...\nEven when they open at 5:30 for dinner, there are people waiting. Staff is smiling and prompt, the fresh and large buffet selection awaits. Service was attentive, but as others have pointed out, silverware and napkins are out on the floor and need to be picked up separately. Minor irritation that there are plastic cups available for condiments by the prime rib station, but not by the cocktain sauce or tempura sauce stations- odd and a little inconvenient. Not to mention the soy sauce on the tables but no cups for that, either.\nHighlights include the make your own udon and dessert crepe sections, the veggie tempura spread, and of course- the seafood. No, the quality isn't what you'll find at the nicer AYCE places off-Strip, but the fish is super fresh and there is a small selection of sashimi, and the quality IS better than your average buffet. \nI really liked that there were about 12 rolls out on display, with labels. No confusion about what random roll I was eating, and the pieces weren't packed with tons of rice. I rather enjoyed that the pieces were cut small, so that I could try a bit of each rather than just a few before filling up.\nIn addition to sushi and sashimi, I also filled up on poke and shrimp cocktail, my usual buffet stand-by. Crab legs are also available at weekday dinner, but I did not partake.\nEDIT; two months later, I'm subtracting a star for lack of consistency. Raved about this place to a fish-loving friend and visited for lunch just after picking him up from the airport. Got here just before 1PM and selection was limited, fish seemed questionably fresh, and overall experience was extremely underwhelming- I was embarrassed to bring someone here."

The Grand Canal, the oldest remaining pioneer canal on the north side of the Salt River, runs 21 miles from 75th Avenue and Camelback Road all the way to Papago Park. You can take your bike or just enjoy a leisurely walk along the path which, thanks to the city of Phoenix and the nearby residential developments, is landscaped in some areas (especially near where it crosses Central Avenue). The path is paved in most areas, though in some areas it's a hard-packed dirt path. This is also a great place to go bird watching, as many birds, especially wading ones, are frequently seen along the route."

This is one of the few restaurants that offer a gluten free bun, let alone a gluten free bun that is delicious, so when I found out they had this option we immediately ran to this restaurant without passing go. Add on the fact they have spiked milkshakes, and I am all set to go.\nThe three burgers I've had at Holstein's are:\nBurger of the Day: Short Rib Burger\nThis burger had huge chunks of melt in your mouth short rib that made everything seem right in the world.\nGold Standard Burger: Dry Aged Beef Sirloin Burger With Smoked Bacon, Aged Goat Cheddar Cheese, Tomato Confit, Baby Arugula & Garlic-Chive Aioli \nThis burger should be the first burger you eat at Holstein's. Everything about it is right. You'd think a burger with that many ingredients would be overwhelming, but it's not. No wonder this burger has gotten them several well-earned awards. Everyone we know that has come to Holstein's with us has loved this burger.\nCaptain Hook Burger:\nGrilled Atlantic Salmon w/Frissee, Pickled Shallots, Herb-Caper Mayo & House Cured Gravlax \nTo be quite honest, I don't know what Gravlax is, but whatever it is I love it and will go back to Holstein's to eat it whenever my waistline can bear it. The salmon was cooked perfectly: tender in the inside with a buttery crust on the outside and definitely not greasy. If you're looking for a lighter option instead f a burger, this is the way to go.\nGo here. You will love every bite. If you have a gluten allergy or not, you will be able to eat their regular french fries (natural cut and good, but nothing life altering) or their sweet potato fries which are a delicious treat in a world that rarely gets sweet potato fries right. If you're looking for less fried, go with the coleslaw. So, so good. Eat up and enjoy!"

First we started off with their twisted potatoes (basically a well seasoned endless string of potato shreds.) it was free with a checkin on 4square. We also sampled the Warm Sourdough Pretzel sticks with a spicy mustard and cheese fondue. I love good apps and these fit the moniker. Huge portions though so beware or you won't have room for your meal. They have many creative burgers and the prices are reasonable. Add to that the adult milkshakes and excellent preparation, this is a diamond in the rough. The only thing keeping this from being 5 star is the atmosphere. It is basically a small bar with a handful of tables and slow service. Still the food makes up for it. Definitely a must try. Just watch the scale :)"

    "text": "We need this damn restaurant in Southern California! I hate the fact that I'll have to travel to Las Vegas or fly out to Texas or the East Coast to get a sandwich from the Earl.\nThe web site claims that the Sandwich family (the same family line of the Earl who invented the sandwich), a restaurateur, and a dude by the name of Earl, created this franchise. It's easy to brag when you can honestly say that you invented stuffing things between bread. The chain also has the blessing of the 11th Earl of Sandwich and have a charter on the home page of their website. That's such great marketing. \nI know what you're thinking: \"franchise\" is a dirty word, especially on Yelp!. But no, this is a good sort of franchise, along the lines of Chick-Fil-A or In-N-Out or some other hyphenated chain.\nYou'll notice that they have images of 18th century individuals and a mug of the Earl himself on the soda cups of the restaurant. There's a Samuel Adams-esque quality about the place. \nThe sandwiches here are not too large, but the flavors stand out and ingredients are fresh. The bread is amazing, firm, but soft when you bite into it. The spreads were very unique, a cross between a honey mustard and barbecue sauce. I ordered the Earl's Club sandwich and I was very pleased to find that the turkey was moist, instead of dry and salty.\nI would say that this franchise is a cross among Corner Bakery, Panera and Lawry's Carvery. They give you a buzzer (at least at this location) and you come back to pick up your sandwich when it's done. Even though the sandwiches take a little longer to make, it's well worth it and you can definitely taste the quality. \nThis particular location is in the Miracle Mile shops in the Planet Hollywood hotel on the Strip. It's like the first thing you'll notice when you enter the mall from the south entrance. The seats spill onto the mall corridor and always seem to be crowded, the latter definitely being a good sign of good shit.\nSo this great place, along with Dunkin' Donuts, are institutions that I have to hit up whenever I'm in Sin City. I don't care what it takes, write a damn petition to the Earl himself and have him set up shop on this far-flung former colony I call western America."

I'm pretty sure my waiter forgot about me as I was seated in what I like to call the \"uncool\" section.

They serve ramen with a choice between 4 different broths and every bowl comes with char-su, mushroom, and green onion.. There are other options that you can add to your noodles for an additional cost too.. The broth was thick and a yellow-milky color which wasn't the best for drinking and the noodles didn't have any distinction that would make them \"the best\" ramen.. We also tried their regular fried rice and that was probably the only thing everyone enjoyed and would come back for again.. But as for the ramen I think I'll pass!"

Having said that there's something about the shows that falls flat, almost like they are adults without kids who are trying to relate to kids. For example, the first 20 minutes of all the shows is all about the \"rules\" which involves keeping your kids in check. I get it, but they're kids, they're going to blurt things out and jump up and down. \nIve seen 3 shows now amd the best one is the 3 little pigs which includes some audience participation. Up until then it's been kids watching a show and encouraged to be quiet. Refreshingly, the wolf puppeteer seems to be more experienced, he engages the kids and annunciates so you can hear him clearly unlike the squeaky Puppet Director that uses the same voice for every character. Maybe it's me but her range is totally annoying and actually distracts, especially when she's constantly humming while other characters are talking, \nRoom for improvement:\nBetter writing. It currently reminds me of bad improv. Some scenes are totally awkward leaving the kids and parents totally quiet when the curtains close. \nI'd like to say better audio but the equipment I'm sitting near is actually pretty good but most people (aside from the wolf) seem muffled or distant and as mentioned lady's voice is hard on the ears. \nContinue working with the kids and not fighting them. The more audience\nparticipation the better. The kids were loving it when the wolf asked them which way the pig went. \nMaybe some pre recorded background announcements with different voices? There's like 6 to 8 individual characters in a show, all sharing 2 voices. \nI appreciate their efforts and would love to see it be way more kid friendly and entertaining so I wouldn't have to burn in hell for bashing a children's puppet show done on a shoestring budget\nIf you are thinking of going, give it a shot, maybe I'm wrong. ."

They have a couple beers on tap, and the standard drinks, and they are all over priced.

This place is loaded with them, especially on First Fridays. Skinny jeans and thick glasses everywhere. Its not a bad thing, but just remember thats the clientele this place caters too.\nMy only complaint about this place is that its tiny. Its real small. Its categorized as a dance club but I have no idea how they could free up some space for a dance floor, in fact I have never seen it.\nThe cool thing about the place is that it does offer a venue for some genuine artists. Everything from spoken word performances, bands, art exhibitions you name it, can be featured here. They def get props for supporting the local art scene. On top of that, they been known to attract some substantial talent like Bloc Party, Ladytron and the B-52's, not bad. The place itself has a cool look: 1950's beauty salon, think Edward Scissorhands. \nBut really, if your not here for specific event, I can't imagine wanting to stay here for more than a quick (albeit expensive) drink."

    "text": "Everyone knows the history of Vegas and should know that the Flamingo Hotel was the first hotel operated by Benjamin (Bugsy) Siegel but alas people think this is the original Flamingo but NO it's not! The original Flamingo was demolished around the 70's to make way for bigger up to date resorts just like they are doing currently. \nI picked the Flamingo because we got a comp room for a Go Room Deluxe Strip View room over the weekend (which can be very pricey) and thought it would be a great deal since it's free on the weekend, recently renovated and right smack on the central strip. We were transferring from Bellagio after staying 2 nights and stayed 2 more nights at the Flamingo and there is comparison between the 2 resorts other then the location. Valet parking was horrible as the line to valet was long until the attendant came and told us the parking garage was full and we had to leave our car outside for it to be parked. We needed the bell guy to take our bags from our car and when he arrived and waited around 20 minutes for him to arrive and when he arrived he picked up the bags and put his hand out and and wanted a tip right away and I thought that pissed me off but I didn't to make a scene so I tipped him a $1. \nGoing to the check in area was a bit of a stretch from the the valet area, you'd have to take the escalator up to the lobby area and walk across the mall area and a few restaurants to get to the front desk where you are greeted with a long line. Also the some of the Flamingo Hotel employees were doing some dance around the lobby area, probably for some employee appreciation thing which I find odd since I never seen that before. The ventilation is a bit smokey and you can also smell a scent they pump in the air like a tropical or coconut smell probably to help clear out the smoke smell. Elevator area was very outdated and very retro 70's like and needed a massive overhaul, the hallway up to the room was very clean in our tower with the pink and white color tones that blends in the the renovated go tower. Not all the towers were renovated as you can tell when walking from one tower to another the hall goes from clean and vibrant to just filthy, old and smokey. \nOur Go Deluxe Room very nice and clean and appreciated the fridge and complimentary coffee maker and 2 coffee packets. The TV was a flat screen but the remove didn't work and so I called housekeeping and found out the batteries were dead but were replaced right away. The beds were very soft but what bothered was the no wifi in the room so I can check for any important email on my phone and check the news on my smart phone. But I'd have to pay $30 for 6 hours only for the hotel part and if I wanted to use it throughout the Flamingo property, I would have to pay more I thought was a total rip off. The bathroom was pretty nice but needed some maintenance with the bathroom door not closing all the way and the shower jets on the wall was a nice touch but it would leave the bathroom partially flooded. I liked the small TV built inside the bathroom mirror but I hardly used it but the AC was very strong in the room ad felt like an ice chest, the view of the strip was a nice touch with the Bellagio fountains in the left side of the window and Caesars in the front but at night you can hear the music from Pure nightclub with the thumb thump sound which didn't annoy me a lot and it did stop around 4 am when I would be getting ready for bed. =P\n \nAfter coming from the Bellagio pool, I didn't expect a lot from the Flamingo pool are other then the pictures I've seen on the website but average and not too classy but was very disappointed. The music was very loud with beer bottles all around the pool and trash floating on the water takes away the ambiance and the crowd was full of undesirables but had some eye candy and that helped out, not too much. The security guards at the entrance felt like I was going through a TSA checkpoint in Los Angeles and asked me to open my bag and checked my ID if I was over 21 so I can stay with in GO pool area. Sadly I always look forward to staying in the pools in Vegas especially in the 100+ heat but I only stayed for less then an hour and decided to just walk to the strip to shrug off this horrible pool experience. \nCustomer service and restaurants were average and the casino needed a major overhaul, they did have a food court in the lobby but it wasn't worth the money spent. \nI gave the Flamingo 2 stars for the location and 1 star for the comped renovated room. \nWould I stay here again?\nMaybe if it was free but I'd rather pay more for a more upscale hotel."

If you see me checking into a buffet, it's usually due to friends/family are in town, it's comped, or I am desperately hungry.

When it comes to taste and satisfaction, good luck with that. I remember years ago where this was one of the better buffets. Times have changed or my taste has change. Either way, I don't see myself going out of the way to eat here. Only reason we stopped here recently was because I had a friend from out of town with me, there wasn't a line, and we were both hungry. \nRio's buffet doesn't compare to M. I haven't been to Bacchanal or Wicked Spoon, but I assume Rio doesn't compare to them either. What made my most recent visit even worse was that my local discount didn't work on NYE. \n4 stars for cleanliness, no wait, and price was better than everyone else on NYE. 2 stars for quality.

The one thing that was kinda annoying was that I had to wait around for the same guys to give me a bucket of balls for the range.

I got tired of waiting and decided to help myself to the balls LOL. \nThe range is nice, hitting off real grass. Didn't have too much time to putt on the practice green but it looked decent.

Sadly, I was hoping to see Drew Carey but went with someone else who still had a lot of showmanship. First thing they show are clips over the years of Price is Right, the high's and low's and mostly funny clips of past contestants.

The quality of the food almost took it down to 3 stars but in the end, their attempt to be really interested and concerned about the provenance of their produce raised it to 4 stars. I felt that I could really taste the difference with the quality of the ingredients used.\nThe restaurant itself has a really rural feel to it despite being minutes from metropolitan Phoenix. The long driveway off the main road seems like a step into another world and the long walk from the car park to the low rise restaurant adds to the distinct impression that you're in the country. The interesting history of the restaurant and its associated projects on the grounds are explained in the menu. There is a changing daily menu and the use of fresh local produce is commendable.\nUnfortunately, for me personally, it just all felt a little sterile and there wasn't much atmosphere in the place. Unlike some over-posh city establishments, I had expected more of a buzz and hubbub in this quaint restaurant but it was almost the opposite. The staff were efficient enough but lacked the true warmth of natural hosts. There was also the amusing view of them bringing in all the dishes from the kitchen which must have been in another building as they were carrying plates in from outside. This became especially interesting when it started raining.\nI started with a board of charcuterie and cheese, which was almost the best course as you could taste the top class ingredients in their pure form. I was interested to taste a pluot for the first time, which was a cross between a plum and an apricot.\nThe next course of squash salad was average and not very exciting.\nPerhaps the worst dish of the evening was cheese pasta with sausage that just had the wrong balance of ingredients. Too heavy for my liking.\nHowever, the next course of steelhead with heirloom tomatoes was much better with perfectly cooked fish accompanied by some super sweet mis-shapen (yay!) tomatoes.\nUnfortunately, this was followed by braised lamb that had unfortunately been over-seasoned.\nThe most spectacular course of the evening was the amazing dessert board. There was melon carpaccio with strawberry, goat's cheesecake, lemon cream, crumb cake, a cookie and truffles.\nIt's a real shame as I had really wanted to like Quiessence before I dined there but the overwhelming feeling as I left was that it could have been so much better."

Nice to have a great hollendaise that I didn't have to prepare.\nService - Our server was so outstanding I'm going to contact the manager at this location.\nAtmosphere - We had a corner table that gave us great privacy. We could not hear our neighbors."

When I called I was told that Bonnie doesn't participate in the Groupon deal, bummer. However, they were able to fit me in that same week with Ray. Ray agreed to stay late (the salon hours are 10am to 6pm) so that I could have a 5:45pm appointment because I couldn't leave work early.\nI'll admit I was a little nervous because (1) I had NEVER died my hair and (2) I wanted to die it red because I didn't want to commit to bleaching it. Also, there was a review on this site that said the stylist I was schedule with hadn't got the right color of red...IGNORE THAT REVIEW. \nI have added my before/after/goal picture to this page. I brought Ray a picture of the shade of red I wanted, dark/natural looking because I work in law and extreme hair color is NOT allowed. Ray gave me fair warning that the color I wanted was difficult to achieve. However, Ray did an excellent job. The red was a natural color and it looks great! Not to mention it is almost an exact match to the picture I brought in :) I couldn't believe it but it was exactly the color I wanted!!! Thanks Ray!!! \nIn addition, it was also one of the best haircuts I've ever had. My hair is really straight and flat but with Ray's amazing layering my cut was perfect and my hair has volume! Not to mention it takes about 5 minutes to do in the morning :)\nThanks Ray! \nI will definitely be back and make Tonic salon and Ray my regular hair place."

The rooms feature possibly the most comfortable beds of any hotel, and a massive living space for you to enjoy during your stay (kitchenette, living room, desk). The Signature is attached to the MGM Grand via several moving sidewalks, and is a nice way to get away from all the crazyness of dinging slot machines and smoking grandmas on the strip, while still being right in the middle of the lights. It's truly an Oasis of luxury in Vegas. You will not be disappointed here if you value relaxation and luxury over the mayhem of tables and slots."

This gives you a much more personal feeling when you watch this show.\nSteve is a little goofy but very entertaining. Many of the tricks can be simple and some he makes a mistake on (or his set does) and you can see what happens, but this is a little more fun in a way. \nI have taken my son with me four times and three of those times Steve has asked him to join him on stage for a little fishing expedition that is very cute and has the crowed \"ahhing\" and laughing at both Steve's antics and the innosense of the child he chooses.\nThe larger tricks are loud and filled with some sense of drama, while others have a personal feel that Steve has developed with the audience through his explanations of why he does magic and how he got started.\nShow up early as they don't necessarily seat you where your ticket says; they may choose to give you a better seat if you are first in line. The photographers are at every show in Vegas, just smile and let them take it and don't buy it if you don't want it. The best part is that Steve will come out after the show and let you take his picture with you and your family after signing his autograph and talking with you.

Well, then you're probably a communist, but they have turkey burgers too!\nWhat about a bun? Do you like a standard, bun? Or maybe you're a healthy person and you want a whole wheat bun?

At Notorious I'm talking about some premium toppings. I'm talking about aged cheddar, bacon ketchup, rich chipotle pepper sauce to spice it up, and avocado to cool it down.\nWe're not done yet people, because don't just bring me a burger on a plate because I need some SIDES. Now a lot of people don't like cole slaw, and I respect that, because it's usually not good (PRO TIP: Load it up with pepper and you can get your daily helping of slaw and pepper at the same time, even if the taste isn't so great). At Notorious, they have some magical slaw. Is it the best cole slaw I have ever tasted? Probably. And they give you a nice helping with a burger. Hey maybe throw it on your burger and go Pittsburgh style! But also give their fries a try. They're not perfect, but they're delicious with a side of bacon ketchup.\nAll of that for maybe $13, which isn't bad for a fancy lunch, and is damn good for a delicious dinner burger.

So was definitely skeptical when we decided to try this place. Dave told the server that we were unfamiliar with the names of the dishes and we asked him to pick out 3 entrees for us. He was EXCELLENT! Even though he had a heavy accent, he explained things to us and we told him what we liked and didn't like. His service was outstanding, attentive and we liked all of his suggestions. And of course, the food was excellent. Freshly prepared and very flavorful. I originally saved the receipt to tell everyone what to get, but I am so long overdue in writing this review the receipt was lost. :-( \nVegetarian or not, I recommend you try this place out.

Every time I went down the lobby I had to make sure I leave the hotel within 10 minutes or I will get a major headache. The vast majority of the people here at Harrah's smoke a lot, so I do not recommend this hotel for any family that has any infants or young children with them. \nThe next thing why I don't like this hotel are the rooms. It's nice to have a simple room for you to sleep in, but there was only one blanket that can barely cover a whole person's body. And not to mention the shower drain was terrible. No matter how much we tried to shut it off it still manages to make small water drops which was hard to deal with. Another bad thing is the air conditioner is very loud up to the point you can lose your sleep over night."

My relationship with the finer things in life is one that either just happens because of the uniqueness of my job (being a magician has its advantages) or results from the shortcuts I happen to know. The membership to the \"ladies who spa\" club is one that belongs to the latter category. I don't go to Vegas spa to receive the various world-class treatments that are equally world-class in price. I get a day pass with my best girlfriends and use the facility. We get to enjoy a dose of indulgence without really burning a wallet hole for it. Vegas is the perfect place to do this, with its abundance in high end spas that even allow day passes.\nI've been to my share of interesting amenities that spa facilities offer in Vegas: Aria has hot stone beds and a shio salt room, Encore has waterfall showers and silk-lined robes, Venetian has a tropical rainshower experience. It's difficult for me to get impressed, which is why I was not, at the Sahra Spa in Cosmopolitan, which means Sahra should probably get four stars in most standards, but not when you compare to the rest of Vegas.\nThe staff is very nice and attentive. The entrance with the high fountain is distinctive. The gym is well-equipped and divided into manageable sections. But it's relatively small overall; there aren't any features that really separate Sahra from the rest. It's a nice enough place to spend the day. The tea selection is nice. The granola is nice. The cool mist room is nice. \nNext time when I'm looking for special instead of nice, I may try spending money on a treatment, which is 20 percent off for locals on weekdays. If it's more than nice, I'll write a review update."

They made reservations without any issues, and we had a party of almost 20.\nWhen we got there at the reservation time, we were seated promptly and were taken care of extremely well which is grand for such a big party in Vegas. The customer service was on point and the food suggestions were a win. We had a several appetizers that they suggested, and we ordered a bottle of red wine and a bottle of white. They were good about refilling our glasses throughout the evening. \nI hate to say it, but I can't recall the dish I got. It was something off-menu, and I probably had too much wine to remember anyways. I remember a positive experience and tasty food, which for a business gathering is really all that matters. I noticed most of the negative reviews were for families or were expecting life-changing experiences because the name \"Wolfgang Puck\" is slapped on the there. It's definitely a more high-end restaurant which lends to the idea that this may not be family friendly. The Wolfgang part? The food isn't bad! I'm not dreaming of the food, but it was good.

I paid $28 for 2 specialty margarita's. One was a full glass (8 oz) and the other was half full. Not worth it.\nThe food was \"good\" at best. We ordered 3 tapas: 1)chicken tacos which had decent flavor but were served with a roasted green onion as garnish. Not easy to eat and very tacky as a garnish. 2) lobster tacos which were the best item we had on our table.....finally....a taco with proper garnish. 3) chorizo sopas which were okay.\nThe service also leaves much to be desired. The hostess were pretty good. The server started off inattentive and really did just enough to not make the meal a complete disaster. When you have 2 guests order 3 tapas I shouldn't have to go to the main bar and request my own side plates. (Thank you bar tender). \nOne positive note on the service, the bus person did a good job making sure we had water in our glasses throughout the subpar experience. \nOverall, save your money and visit any mom & pop Mexican restaurant in the Vegas valley for a more authentic meal and easier on the wallet!"

Upon arrival, I am somewhat disappointed, as I was expecting windmills, castles and such within my vision of a mini golf course. Instead, it is just a mini golf course built in a parking lot, which is then fenced off. \nBut in spite of my mini golf stereotype being shattered, the entire mini golf outing turned out to be a lot of fun. Putt Park managed to squeezed 18 holes and a practice putting green within a fairly small square footage of space, almost like magic. And the course was fun to play, and I can see this as a fun and relaxing way to spend some quality time with your friends, doing an activity that is a little different from the regular routine. If I have to point out some things I didn't like or could be improved upon for Putt Park, it would be the maintenance on some of the lights on the course. For serious and very competitive mini golfers, having good lighting to see the lay of the course is critical in completing a good round of mini golf. For others, it is a bonus challenge to the course. \nThe office/shop where you go to rent your club(s) and get your colored golf balls is just immediately across from the mini golf course, and it is just a large room with a few wooden picnic tables, 2 games, a refrigerator with beverages for sale and a counter where the Putt Park employee works behind. Nothing too special, but very functional.\nThey offer annual passes and have other promotions. For birthday parties, they have a trophy to give out. I think Putt Park is a fun place to hang out or to organize a get together at, especially during the cooler time of the year in Las Vegas. During the hot summer months, I don't think it will be as fun to go to, since it does take some time to work your way through the 18 holes course, especially if you are with a large group or stuck behind one."

He is so kind, thorough, knowledgeable and very cutting edge with all his techniques. I have had CO2 laser, Ultherapy (amazing results) and recently filler. I was very reluctant and nervous to have filler but he was conservative and skillful. I am thrilled with the results. Between the Ultherapy and filler I feel like 7 years have come off. I highly, highly recommend Phoenix Skin."

The naan was pretty good, and I loved the tandoori chicken, but I wish there was more variety in general and more spicy options.\nWhat I didn't like was the arrangement of the buffet. Way too cramped especially when I am rushing to eat my plate full of food! Also, the table they sat us at was terrible for buffet-ing because it was a booth and hard to get in and out. They need more veggies.\nOverall it was a good experience. Recommended for the $8.95 lunch buffet!"

This was the lunch crowd and many business/office folk have also discovered this place. \nThe staff works feverishly to get the order out in a timely matter, and the wait is minimal. \nThe menu is typical Mexican cuisine, but the portions are huge. The Carne Asada Taco has an incredible flavor...one that I have never tasted before and the shrimp cocktail in a beer mug was sweet, spicy and flavorful.\nTheir fruit waters (strawberry, cantaloupe, mango and pineapple), are also the perfect touch to this menu (although I could have enjoyed a good sangrais or mojito!).\nIf you are looking for a quick grab and go that will leave you full, this is a place you need to check out!"

We sat at the \"rail\" and enjoyed the cooking show. The cooks were all engaged and willing to answer our questions about what they were cooking. My husband's food was great, the rainbow ceviche and beef tenderloin were both well prepared and quite tasty. The tuna on my ceviche was perfect but the sauce (Thai basil) was forgettable. Pick a different one. My entree, the cau cau of seafood was really nice ,except for the langostina. It had that mushy texture to it. Everything else on the plate was well cooked and tasty. \nMy biggest complaint was the incredibly slow and lackluster service. It took too long to get drinks, too long to order, too long to get our check and way too long to pay. Additionally, it's an open kitchen and more than once, we saw hot food sitting on the line for way too long. The manager on duty seemed oblivious to this as he walked by a number of times. Their shortcomings are quite fixable with a more dedicated staff and attention to detail."

My last visit was to celebrate my friend's wedding. So she was still in her wedding dress for dinner. \nJoshua was our server and he's amazing. Funny, knowledgeable about the menu, and attentive. I will definitely ask to sit in his section next time I go. To start we had the black pepper calamari & rock shrimp. I ordered the rib eye and my boyfriend ordered the salmon. Both cooked to perfection and delicious. Sides ordered were creamed corn, asparagus and the mashed potatoes. For desert I had the chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream and crumbled bacon. It was amazing. The sweet and salty combination was perfect. My favorite part of the meal is the variety of sea salts the provide to try on the different items. I don't remember what salt goes with what items but the black salt was amazing on the steak! \nThey were nice enough to serve us a round of champagne to toast the newlyweds. I utilized a restaurant.com coupon for this visit as I have done in the past. They never expire and Envy certs sell out fast so if you see one buy it and ask to sit in Joshua's section.

I mean even with the lights on (looking at you, Starlight), and the seats are first rate. Not as good as Ballantyne or anything, but definitely worthy of sitting in for a movie.\nEven better is that you have multiple eating options prior to the movie, to fit just about any budget, and after you can head right outside the front door for some froyo. Tough to beat. The only problem is that the exits are a little goofy - if you choose to not go out the front, you'll be outside the back door with no easy way to the parking deck."

    "text": "If I could I would give our March 2014 meal at Nobu @ Caesar's Palace 0 stars for service and 4 stars for food; 2 stars is my compromise. The exceptionally high prices are a given. Our lunch for 4 cost $500, and we weren't too full to skip dinner. The food, in general, was very tasty. Surprising standouts included the shishito peppers and the spicy miso chips with big eye tuna. The kumamoto oysters were shockingly disappointing; without the salsa toppings, they would have been completely flavorless. The black miso cod was also disappointing, probably because it was not as warm as it could have been. Which leads me to the real problem with the meal--the service. Our waiter, Ryan, was exceedingly condescending from the get-go. Beyond that, he spoke way too fast (and this was the consensus from 3 New Yorkers) while also failing to enunciate. He arrived at the table with way too much attitude and launched into his poorly delivered spiel despite our telling him that one of our party of four was in the rest room. When that person returned, he was less than willing to fill her in on what she'd missed. Ryan kept wanting us to let him design our menu, but since my preference would have been to see him fired on the spot, I was not inclined to let him choose our food. I cannot overemphasize how much undeserved attitude Ryan was dishing out. Our group had never seen anything like it, and between the four of us, we have eaten in great restaurants around the globe. Beyond the service problem of Ryan himself, we were also quite unhappy about the tremendous speed with which each course arrived at the table and the equally swift way in which even not yet finished plates were whisked away. One could either eat one's food as quickly as possible, without having the opportunity to savor it, or let it sit on the table, growing cold, as my black cod did. I've had significantly slower fast food. In general, I don't like to rate the quality of a restaurant based on its service rather than its food, but in this case, the horrendous service made the food much less palatable. Nobu management should be embarrassed by the restaurant's service failings."

No paperwork was left notifying us that we had been sprayed until I noticed the withdrawal of the $75 from my account.

They refused to refund the money because they \"they serviced our house\" even though it was supposed to be cancelled. Next we find out that we have to pay 75% of the contract to get out of it.\nThis company is HORRIBLE and the CSR are rude and misleading.

When we got there it actually looked closed from the outside especially since the OPEN sign wasn't lit, but we took a chance and opened the door anyway to find that it was indeed open. \nIt's a tiny little place with a Dia de los Muertos theme, so it was rich with color and culture. There was only one server so it was a little slower than we'd like, but in her defense, she was pregnant. \nWe each had to order the horchata with pecans and melon because it sounded so good. The cup it came in was HUMUNGOUS and thank goodness for that because it was awesomely delicious! We also pigged out on the chips and variety of salsas at the salsa bar. The salsas are seriously amazing and there were a lot to choose from and taste. I especially loved the jicama salsa. \nI ordered 2 carne asada tacos with rice and beans. I was already so full from eating all those chips and horchata and usually it's hard for me to enjoy the taste of something after I'm super full, but the tacos were so good I finished them.

About 20 mins later our waiter came by and I asked him about the three additional seats. He , with much attitude rudely informed me that there was no way the could find 3 extra seats (even though it was 8pm and there were hardly filled to capacity ). I began to state what I was told about the event manager and began to pull out my phone to show the trail of conversations between the manager and myself from early in the week. Again, he with much attitude didn't want to hear what I had to say and in fact abruptly cut me off stating he did not care what evidence I had, and the manager I had communicated with was no longer with the company . I calmly asked for the manager and he said you can ask for the manager but it won't change anything. I said that's fine, please ask the manager over anyways . \nHere I am , coordinating a birthday party with 15 folks...sir I really don't want to get into a argument over 3 extra seats \nThere was more back and forth with the manager . She stated the seats would cost and I let her know there was no problem so the seats were brought over\nAs apart of the package , the birthday guest get to come up on stage and do a little dance and have some fun. We were there three hours before finally my husband had to ask someone when our guest would be called off. He was told, if you don't pay extra you don't get called up. WHAT ??!! \nIn fact, it all makes sense now because we must have put in ten song request and not one was played. \nAll in all, it was a bad experience .

The standard, the beef and the shrimp. The shrimp was my favorite the other were delicious. For desert we had the el Domingo. A unique dessert!! It was great. To top off our evening when we got to out bikes there was a coupon thanking us for riding in and we now can go back for 3 free tacos. What a great perk!! It was worth the 6 miles we rode and the extra perk made our night even better."

But (and the buts are significant), we arrived just before 11 am, and were told the wait would be about 30 min. It was actually almost 60 min. Obviously the actual wait time is not in the control of the Host Stand staff and they were super nice when we checked in about where we were on the list. But they need to get a better handle on estimating wait times. When we were seated, our server took our order, brought us waters, and disappeared. He didn't bring the drinks we ordered and after 30+ minutes, we went to the bar and asked for our Bloody Mary. He checked in with us and we reminded him of our Horchata order. And he disappeared again. 15+ minutes later our food arrived (delivered by someone who wasn't our server) but no Horchata. We resorted to asking the Host Stand about our Horchata, for more salsa, and for a refill on our waters. That got taken care of and everyone seemed to be confused about what happened to our drink orders. We were confused about that, but also how our server never managed to check in with us about water, or when we could expect our food, or ??? until we'd already taken matters into our own hands. So - the service - more specifically - our server needs to get a better handle on how to do his job. \nBut - the food was great (Spring Break Diet, CYC Omelet, and Pastrami Rueben) and the drinks were very nice. The donut we had while waiting for our table was tasty as well. \nOverall, we'd go back, but not a peak time on a weekend, and we'd likely try to sit at the bar as that service seemed to be turning over rapidly. \nIt is a busy and noisy environment, I'm not sure it's good for groups or for kids during peak times (just due to the waiting, the noise, etc). Based on the appearances of other diners though - it apparently is the HIPSTER place to be. ;-) \nAnd, I really hope they get a better handle on estimating wait times and training servers (or our server at least)."

Not to mention, they have the one thing i MUST drink in the mornings when in Vegas- mimosas! They are super generous with the champagne to orange juice proportion. So you can get a super nice buzz when walking out of the buffet!\nCan I start with how much of a crush I have on the Wynn dessert room? They have ice creams in so many different flavors and various toppings. They have little plates of cakes, mousses, brownies, cookies and my favorite- TIRAMISU! I could eaten those all day long!\nIf you come here, you MUST try the following:\n1. Their strawberries are to die for! So yummy with the cream that they have on the side. I love eating it with the brown sugar and whipped cream. \n2. Their Caesar salad was delicious! I love the cheese and dressing.\n3. Visit the omelet station! I mean it! Don't skip out on it! It is so delicious!\n4. Get their mimosas! It will make you feeling nice for the rest of the morning.\nIt a guarantee that I will be coming back the next time in Vegas. I love strolling around the Wynn hotel after my buffet. Perfect way to digest by walking through the beautiful hotel."

I have dined at Bandera numerous times with everyone from in-laws to business associates trying numerous dishes including fish, chicken, lamb, and steaks. The lamb will melt in your mouth, the chicken is wonderful, and the steaks enchilada style are sizzling in more ways than one! \nIt's been a wonderful experience each time as far as the food and the atmosphere. The lighting is wonderful, it casts a very warm flattering glow over the ugliest of my friends and it is definitely a place to take a date or celebrate with friends. Well over 95% of the time the service is spot on, they are responsive, friendly, accurate, etc. but there have been a few small preventable mistakes (the nights in question were very busy so it is somewhat understandable)."

    "text": "With hardly two hours to kill between shows, the boy and I dashed up to Grassmarket from the Royal Lyceum, starving and desperate. I mentioned that I've been wanting to try Maison Bleue, from the look of their menu, and we squeaked in just in time to catch the tail end of the pre-theatre menu. (Well, more like inter-theatre menu in our case, but I digress.) £12 for two courses? Don't mind if I do.\nOf course, I quickly ruined the deal by ordering a £25 bottle of Australian Shiraz Tempranillo while the boy was in the loo - luckily he wasn't too upset once he tried the wine because it was quite delicious. Worth the price tag and then some.\nFor our starters we had the smoked salmon & mackerel rilettes and the steamed Shetland mussels - both great, although the crostini for my rilettes were a little on the tooth-breakingly hard side. No matter. For mains I opted for the chicken tagine while the boy went with the steak. Again, both great, although I did wish my tagine was a little less authentic in that it had boneless chicken. Again, no matter - the flavors were worth it. Pleasantly stuffed, we lingered too long over our wine and had to book it back to the Lyceum, squeaking in just before curtain. The moral of this story is: don't do like we did - give yourself plenty of time to enjoy Maison Bleue, because it deserves to be enjoyed."

It was extra special walking into the club and seeing the gorgeous and dramatic up-close view of the Bellagio fountain show going on in the backdrop. If you stand right at the balcony during the fountain show, you might get misted on! But it was fun! \nWe were on the free guest list and arrived early, around 10:40pm on a Saturday night. The line wasn't too long at all, probably a 10 minute wait at most. As the evening progressed, the place got packed! It's very tight quarters inside with a tiny dance floor and not much space to dance. Definitely arrive early in order to enjoy the venue. \nThe music was your typical club hip hop. Nothing out of the ordinary and nothing that really got me in the mood to dance. \nThe bouncers here were a step above in the professional department, unlike Hakkasan. Some of the bouncers were helpful and friendly, some where indifferent, but none were blatantly rude.\nHowever, the bartenders were insultingly rude to my girlfriends. We were at the back bar that's closer to the bathrooms, and my friends had a few 'free guest-list drink tickets', they asked the bartender questions about what types of drinks we could get with them, but the bartender was unnecessarily nasty and replied with some serious snarky attitude and spoke to them like they were deaf wild animals. She also threw their ID's at them since she felt that she wasn't going to get a tip. Unfortunately, we were all super over that lady and didn't get her name, but she was blond and had a boy cut/short hair. I'd avoid her at all costs."

I had never been to a buffet in Las Vegas but made sure to make a point to visit one this time around. I really wish I would've gone to the buffet at the Wynn beause the reviews for it are stellar!\nMy girlfriends and I arrived at the buffet around 130pm for lunch the price was great about $23 and the cashier was friendly. There were maybe four people ahead of us so there was no wait and there were tons of open tables. After paying they had us wait there at the register for the Hotess to come and take us to our table. After about 10-15minutes of waiting there were about 10-15 people lined up behind us all paid and waiting on the Hostess. By this time we are asking the cashier 'what's the hold up?\" and \"why is it taking so long to be seated?\" The sweet lady (shikieko) who took our proof of payment was getting flustered because we weren't the only customers questioning the wait. Another man in line offered to go and find the Host for her because she expressed that she couldn't leave her post. After a few minutes more of complaining from all the customers waiting Shikieko ran off to find the Host who were no where in site. They came strolling out in a pair (one was named Kirly, she was especially RUDE) without any sense of urgency and still chatting to one another as they approached us. At this point a friend of mine was was pissed and requested to speak to the manager. The manager took a minute to come out as well so when she came we were all already at the buffet rushing to get food because we were on our way to the airport. Once we got to our table the manager (Brittany) was standing there. She started by saying \"Did you all want to speak with a manager?\" We replied \"yes we did we are not satisfied with the service we recieved at the front counter! The Host are not friendly and have no sense of customer service or urgency we have been waiting for nearly 15 minutes to be seated and there are several tables available\" Before I could finish she replied \"oh well they came as soon as they could they were busy clearing tables, but ill talk to them\". Before I blurted out BITCH what fuck is your problem you owe us a damn apology!!!!! My gf stepped in and said \"Tthey were no where in site and a 15 minute wait is just unacceptable when there are several free tables. It's not busy in here and they could have thanked us for waiting, apologized or something!\" Brittany replied \"oh ok well ya I will talk to them.\" We also brought in a cake with us. We had no intentions of cutting the cake there our plan was to grab a cocktail at a lounge in the Aria and cut the cake there. Brittany made sure as she walked away from the table to say \"oh by the way you all can't cut that cake in here!\" We were extremely pissed at this point.\nSo we conitued to eat, but the food was nothing spectactular. They had a a few dishes from several different cuisines (Italian, Mexican, Japanese, American, seafood, roast beef, and a pasta bar) Im a vegetarian so I wasn't impressed. I had a a few avacado rolls, vegetable rolls, mixed green salad, corn on the cob, french toast and tofu salad. Believe it or not the best thing was the damn french toast everything else I tried was so mediocre. So after we ate we decided to cut our cake and offer our sweet server Shikieko some she decilened; but wecontinued to nibble and left the rest there in hopes the manger would see!!!!\nDON'T GO HERE THE MANAGER IS BEYOND RUDE SO WHAT CAN EXPECT FROM HER RAGEDY ASS EMPLOYEES!!!!!!\nReally sad my stay at the Aria ended this way!"

I found the inside of the restaurant a bit over done with their ornaments, especially with the small statues all placed around their bar near the cash register, but the picture frames with the elephants and buddhas were tastefully placed around the dining tables. The bamboo blinds were a very good addition to the ambiance. I especially liked the color of the tables and chairs, a kind of warm brown....\nThe dishes took long to arrive, but probably because there were a lot of us who were ordering. The waitress did her job well and was very informative on what dishes we should try next. The refill of our glasses were very prompt and even early...my glass was only three-fourths full and she would come and refill it right away. The waitress was always smiling and in good spirits. Great service.\nWe ordered 4 dishes - spicy noodles, chow mien, Thai basil, and silver noodles. They were all pretty good and tasty! I liked the spicy noodles the best! It had a light savory sauce and the saltiness was just right. The silver noodles with black bean sauce was a bit salty for me but it was delicious all the same. Thai basil was served with rice, it was also good but I'm not very fond of anise flavor. We had the Thai Basil in mild and we later found out it was better if it were a lot more spicier. \nThe chow mien was delightful, it was my second favorite among the four. It had a thick spicy sauce and crunchy vegetables. All the dishes with their noodles and vegetables were cooked just right and their noodles were a bit chewy at first but when it cooled down a bit, it was soft and yummy...I like mine chewy though. =) Every thing really smelled good!\nIt was a great dining experience.

The remoulade sauce was a nice complement for them as well. \nI ordered the Seafood Gumbo and my mom got the Shrimp Jumbalaya and both were generous servings with rice and, peppers and Andouille sausage. The funny thing however was that there wasn't much difference between the two in terms of look and composition. Strange. I mean we were both happy and the taste was excellent but they were almost the same. In fact, I might suggest getting the Gumbo because its significantly cheaper. But yeah, the doppleganger effect was odd. \nOverall prices are reasonable, service crisp and friendly and food pretty darn good. They're not reinventing the wheel at Rhythm Kitchen but they are serving up decent New Orleans style cuisine. \nSometimes its best to leave a mystery a mystery because your not happy with what you find out and its better to dream about all the possibilities that could be.....thats not the case here. I'm glad I made it into Rhythm Kitchen to explore and I'm sure I'll be back again."

It didn't disappoint, as the burgers were absolutely delicious! The oxtail chili fries are a must-have and all the burgers were yummy, exotic, and had a nice Asian Fusion twist to them to make them stand out from your average American hamburger. Come with your appetite, as the fries alone will fill your stomach!"

Making an appointment was easy and upon arrival they quickly gave me a run down on the dresses, etc. The girls working that day were very friendly without being overly pushy. They allowed my friend and I to look through all the dresses and select the ones I wanted to try on. However, they did discuss with me what I was looking for and pulled a few dresses as well. The store is very cozy with a nice sitting area that friends and family can rest and enjoy the dress trying show. The girls were good at clipping the dresses to fit and offering suggestions for belt pairings as well. Really the reason they get only 3.5 stars for me....pricing....same dress and designer from 3 bridal stores in town all priced differently. I saw a Maggie Sottero dress that was in the running and decided to get price quotes from each of the three main bridal shops in town. Bridal elegant came in with the highest price, Celebrations 2nd highest, Bowtie bridal the lowest. I emailed the store and asked if they would consider matching the price of their competitors but I never got a response back...or I guess the response would be no. I still would recommend going to this store since they have some designers that other stores in town don't carry and they have quite a wide selection of dresses but for those budget conscious...make sure you make a price comparison before purchasing! You might be able to find the same dress for less :)"

I did see expected results - but please do your research before signing up so you don't have the wrong expectations. Scheduling can be tough. Try to schedule your appointments ahead of time and keep them, otherwise you may not get in for a few weeks. This particular location is wonderful!\nI would rank the customer service 0 stars. I have NEVER had a good experience calling the 1-800 number. From scheduling errors, to billing issues, and finally canceling my membership. Every time, something bad. Since I can't rate the location itself and the customer service # separately, I will go halfway and give them 2 stars. \nThe pricing is great! My advice: try a groupon first, if you like it, and can afford to pay for a package up front, that's the way to go. Too many issues with their monthly billing, and customer service - if they made improvements in policies and customer service it would be an overall better place."

They prepare it in front of you, unless you order pick-up. They also have a kids option in which they package the toppings and provide a kids size pizza to build at home with your little one. Fun!

Yes, the menu taped into hardcover books, the green lamps, and the decoupage table tops are cool. I was sad that our server took our menus away after we ordered--I wanted to read the Babar the Elephant storybook that was one friend's menu. \nI had the Alice in Wonderland sandwich, which was a portobello mushroom sandwich with roasted red peppers and Boursin cheese. Since it was a blustery night, I was very happy that it was a warm sandwich, not a cold one, and a delicious one at that. I do wish that the slices of bread were larger, though, because every time I bit into the sandwich, the cheese would ooze out the sides and onto the plate. As my side, I ordered sweet potato fries, which were all right but not as crispy as I like them. The smoked jalapeno aioli that came with the fries, however, was fantastic. \nThe food isn't that imaginative as the literary names of the dishes might suggest, but it's solidly executed. The draft specials during happy hour (5-7 pm, I think) are a good deal, and the noise level during this time is still conducive to conversations with friends. Service seemed to be on the slow side, but it did seem like we came in at the very beginning of the Friday night hustle and bustle."

I don't know if this is how this joint is run, or if every incompetency the staff could muster just happened to fall on our heads that weekend, but I left never wanting to stay anywhere near a Wynn hotel again. First, the place was severely understaffed, and the people who did work there clearly didn't give a sh*t, which only made everything that happened afterward worse. \nWhen we got to our suite, the lock on the door to the adjoining room was destroyed and there were champagne splatters all over our ceiling. When we called someone to come inspect the room they said they would be up in 15 minutes; 2 hours later we called again and the girl at the front desk said the person who took our previous call never even sent anyone up. 45 minutes later when someone did come up to inspect it, they said they would take care of it later. The maintenance staff for the door was nice, but when housekeeping came in to clean up she stole/threw one of my articles of clothing that I left sitting on the bathroom sink away! Who does that?? When I called to complain the front desk said they would ask our housekeeper what happened, then never followed up.\nThe room when clean was nice enough, but at night we could hear the people above us partying through the vents all night long.\nWhen we finally left the hotel, the valet took 40 minutes just to find our car; people who came after us were sent away in less than 5. Even after we left our friends had to wait another 20 minutes before the valet found their car. The valet's excuse? They \"lost\" our cars. Even worse, when we pulled over at a gas station down the road my boyfriend noticed that the valet had somehow punctured a hole in the leather upholstery on the door of his Mercedes. I don't know if Steve Wynn's blind ass poked his thumb through the upholstery like it was a Picasso, but that's just ridiculous.\nI will never come back here. There are nice stores and restaurants attached to this place, which is a shame, but I wouldn't dare patronize this establishment in any way again."

But when it was pointed out, I said, \"I think I've found my home here.\" I wasn't wrong. The relatively new (June 2012) Hambar is in a space adjoining the St. Paul Hotel. The lure? A gorgeous piece of art that's also at the center of the restaurant's reason for being: A beautiful window case display of prosciutti, serrano hams and other charcuterie. This, I though, was reason to go on in for a recon mission. \nThe hostess was very friendly and spoke English and French (as do most Quebecois) and had none of the too-often maligned \"French-ness\" that puts off those who don't speak it. We explained that we had just finished lunch, but she was more than willing to talk about their menu, wines and best times to come. As it turned out, we'd return only six hours later to do a full frontal assault on it. \nHambar has a cocktail like lighting and feel, and the groups inside ranged from mid-20s through seniors. Everyone felt comfy, though, and again the waitress was quick to spend time to explain the daily specials, and then pointed out which wines they had by the glass in addition to those in their voluminous full-bottle wine list. \nWhen she returned with cocktails, she asked if we had questions, which we did. Her advice? We had too much on our minds and that their portions were pretty generous. If we wanted more it wouldn't be a problem. Now when's the last time that happened to you? Me, neither. Never! Her recommendation was the small platter, which was more than generous. We also tried the prosciutto croquettes (bits of ham in cheese, then panko breaded and friend.... awesome). The platter had both prosciutto, serrano ham, black serrano, and a variety of other charcuterie. \nEvery bite was a a treat. Each new item was a delicious surprise. Each minute in the place conveyed happiness and a great exploration. My first thought was wondering how someone in Chicago could open a place like this and keep it close enough to where I lived that I'd be able to go at least once a week. \nI've been very stingy in giving five stars to any restaurant, but if I'm ever going to give one, this place rates it. While I have a whole lot of new places and cities I want to visit for food, this place would be enough to get me to return to Montreal. There's more in this great food city, but I'd do both dinner and breakfast at Hambar."

We sat down on the patio, where most of the other guests were, for ten minutes before the manager came over and asked if we had been helped. He got us some water and sent the server over. He took our orders and later dropped off the food and drinks. We didn't see him again for quite a long time. I was at a bar and my drink was gone and had no way of getting a new one. Every time the waiter was at our table, it was because the manager had told him to go there. \n I had to ask the manager for my bill because the server was nowhere to be found and I no longer had any interest in staying. Once again, the manager handled the situation very well (sending the waiter over and discounting the bill). After we had the bill, the waiter seemed to magically remember we existed. He was hovering over us while i was taking my wallet out and watching me put money in the book. It was really uncomfortable. The moment the book closed, the waiter had it in his hands. He ran over to the computer looked obviously upset at his small tip. (as a service worker myself i rarely tip below 15% even for crappy service. this service warranted $1 however.) \n Nobody expects incredible service in a bar. It's a real laid-back place. I do expect some service though. It is, after all, why their salary is based on tips. The server made us feel more than unwelcome in the bar, but actually feel like our presence was a burden. Our experience could have been completely if we had a decent server. Our server was not simply bad, he was neglectful of his job. I took my business down the street to world of beer and tipped my excellent waiter $30 on my $100 tab. I may give handlebar another shot, but I will be sitting at the bar if i do.

The salad was very refreshing and it had goat cheese on top. The meatballs were tender. The fritters were not fishy. It was a perfect sampler for a group of 4.\nWe ordered a Poppy Burger with extra Poppy Fries, Kimchi Fried Rice, Crispy Pork Belly, Charred Bok Choy and Roasted Duck Breast. My favorites were the burger, fries, fried rice and pork belly. The burger was perfectly cooked and seasoned. The fries were crisp and came with a yummy cheese sauce. The fried rice was not kimchi overload. Pork belly was crispy on the outside, soft and moist on the inside. We also got the Quinoa Fried Rice. Honestly, it was too sweet for me. It was my least favorite item that we got. The duck was also on the sweet side.\nFor dessert, we got Chips and Ice Cream. The chips were homemade but they weren't crisp. There were 2 ice cream flavors: caramel/toffee and lemon poppy. Both were good. It was a great dessert for the texture and sweet and savory elements.

It felt like being on a marshmallow. \nThis place is difenetely far from the strip but you can always get the 24 hour bus pass for $7 so you don't have pay for a taxi. From the Stratosphere to Circus Circus, it's $8 on a taxi. If you don't want to wait for the bus, you can always rent a scooter for $30 for 24 hours and drive around wherever you want.\nThe swimming pool could have been a lot better but atleast you get a nice view of the city since it's on the 8th floor of the hotel. \nThere's lots of slots and the tables start at $5 minimum. I didn't really have much luck with the slots but my boyfriend did win $40 on a slot machine. Lucky him. I won $10 on Roulette. The tables here are kind of harsh, we went through $120 in like an hour. \nIf you want to get a great view of the city, go to the tower and you'll have to pay $16 for each person. I haven't gone myself but i've heard it's def. worth it. \nThey always have really good prices for rooms as it is far from the strip but there's always the bus and rental scooters."

We were hooked up with a private room, so we didn't have a problem with sound level. You can actually adjust the music volume and the brighness. BTW, the music was a really good mix.\nThe service was really excellent. Our busser was in very frequently and our waiters checked-in very often as well.\nNow to the food:\nI got the 34 oz Cowboy Ribeye with Fois gras topping.\nMaybe it was a mistake getting such a gigantic cut of meat, but what's done is done.\nThe steak has some black char surrounding it. This is very different from any other steak house that I have been to. The char wasn't my favorite but for the larger cuts it does help break up the soft texture of the meat. THe body of the meat was perfectly medium-rare served with two side sauces (one sweeter, one more savory). THe fois gras was delicious and is a DEFINITE must-do, you can't get fois gas in California!\nSo yes the steak was great, but the char brought it down. Fois gras topping was excellent.\nPrivate-room made it very comfortable, but I don't think I would have liked it in the main areas.\nService was excellent for the private room.\nBathroom was crazy small, single stall!\nI would probably give closer to a 4, but some unusual things (the super char and the bathroom) brought it down for me."

    "text": "Wow.\nMy husband and I went to Old Towne yesterday and saw this little gem, but I had already agreed we'd pay homage to HIS heredity and have Phó (that review is also included!). But, we tucked this in the back of our minds and I'm glad we did!\nThe staff was an extremely pleasant woman who was fluent in English, Polish, and French. She was sweet, attentive, and knew the city like the back of her hand. She recommended our vodka and suggested to accompany it with apple juice, a \"chaser\" if you will. She said it was \"how the Polish do it\", so why not? When in Rome.....It was smooth, strong, and I felt content immediately. The turpentine aftertaste (all vodka does to me, regardless of brand, but some better than others!) was immediately quashed by the sweetness of the juice. I will never drink vodka any other way hereafter!\nI am an embarrassment to my Polish and Irish heritage - I hate cabbage (!) - so I went with the pierogies. Cheese. My husband was easily swayed into the gobki.\nMy dish came artfully arranged with a sprinkle of dill, a heaping side of sauerkraut and carrot shaped into a rosette. My husband's order was accompanied by a cucumber/dill sauce mix and sliced boiled potatoes.\nThe pierogies tasted like my Babçi came back to life and got work in their kitchen. Very authentic. Dipped in the side bowl of sour cream, it was delicious!\nMy husband inhaled his dish (and half of mine) within seconds, which usually is a sign he likes it. The gobki appeared to have an abundance of ground meat, which is a nice change from the rice-laden cabbage rolls I usually see. He stated the tomatoes were an excellent topping, as it was a bit dry inside of the roll. He found the cucumber/dill muxture to be divine. Not his words, but \"wicked good\" isn't exactly poetry, but a good description nonetheless!\nThe ambience is divine and the bar nicely stocked. (side note: the building's side door also gives access to bathrooms without going through the restaurant). Our waitress informed us live music is usually at the restaurant nightly of we wanted to cone back for dessert and Polish coffee (coffee with vodka....of course!)\nThe menu may have been simple and don't offer a huge array of options, but sometimes that can be overwhelming. So points today for simplicity.\nIf you are a fan of Polish food - this is authentic as it gets. A MUST when in Montreal and desire something different than American and after a few days in Quebec, something different than French!"

    "text": "I normally write separate reviews for each visit but these visits are only days apart. \nVISIT #1\nI came with some Yelperazzis for a snack before a Yelp event ( yes, we ate before a food sampling event and we went to eat after that too). We just decided to share some bits at the recommendation of David who has tried a extensive bit of the menu. \nThe short rib and beef cheek sandwich was the star for me. It was beautifully braised and tender and I love their housemade stone ground mustard with a horseradish kick.\n I hate when a place can make a Shepherds pie that puts mine to shame (and I know mine is fucking delicious) but this did me in. I like that its a combo of lamb and beef and the gravy of it was savory and worth sopping up if there's some left after devouring (save a piece of bread or ask for some!). \nThe deviled eggs were good in that the bacon does add a kick to it, but to me a deviled egg is just alright. \nPei mussels and clams were perfectly cooked and the broth with it was solid and had a nice saffron flavor.\nI got the Magic Hat #9 to drink which was nice and freshly apricot to cut the richness of the food. \nService was on point. Lovely, funny, enthusiastic Elise took such great care of us, filled our drinks, checked in on us, gave great recommendations and got us checked out in a flash. \nVISIT #2\nA few days later I return for my BFs friends birthday with a large party of 10 people. It was much busier on a Saturday night than the weekday we came. \nThe BF and I got the duck confit poutine to start as I really wanted it when I came last but they were out. I say it's rather good and comforting, lots of shredded confit to go around for each bite of fries. I don't know if I would call it poutine as I normally have a much thicker gravy, but this au jus gravy situation was densely rich. We tried bites of our friends scotch egg which was a great version of a dish I am a big fan of. One friend got some pub spot sliders which was okay but a bit too well done for my taste. \nThe BF got fish and chips which I thought was a solidly done one. I definitely am a fan of their tartar sauce! They don't give you malt vinegar automatically but ask if you want it. They have this garlic aioli that came with someones order but I asked for more to dip the steak fries in. If you love aioli on potatoes like I do, it'll elevate your fries. \nI got the Irish beef cheek stew and fuck me sideways it was so tender and perfect. I did need some more potato but people kept throwing me their log fries so I mashed that into the jus and aaahhh, noms. Clean plate of course. Between this, the short rib and cheek sandwich this place knows how to braise meat to meltingly tender. \nI had to get some sticky toffee pudding and it was delicious. It's one of my all time favorite comforts and theirs was definitely everything this is supposed to be. People wanted to taste and inside in my head was screaming \"no, no, no\" while I shared nicely like my mommy taught me. \nEveryone was happy with their food. One of our friends orders wasn't put in... It worked out since there was no way another friend could finish their sandwich so they shared and they expedited a duck confit poutine for him. \nService was decent enough from our server and another server helping our table with water a few times. The person who white knighted the service though was our busser David that helped get all our random sauces and got to some ignored sodas and waters a few times.\n The thing that really blew chunks was we were held hostage for the bill. People shoulda spoke up to maybe split before things were even ordered so that part was our fault, but the way it was split was so inefficient. Went to one person and asked what they ordered and then disappeared and going one by one and coming back to recheck and check again and again which is which. He came to ask us what we had twice after the first time. \nSplit checks during my first visit was painless. She tabbed which person is whose on one big check then came with one check back that split it into seat #1, #2, #3, etc. to make sure it was right then paired the card/cash to the seat and came back with our individual receipts - done. This took forever this time when I really think it shouldn't have been that hard to get items to the right person. A little wait was expected, but we waited almost as long for checks than our entire meal duration. One friend was salty they got attitude from the server about the bill? I did not witness or asked for a elaboration. Apparently this place also runs with having a cashier settle bills for the servers and they only have one? This place is packed so I think they may need another if a lot of people are waiting. \nPleased with the food and my first visit but coming with a smaller party at non peak hours to sit in Elises section! I'll average it to a 4stars as \"I'm a fan\", but warn big parties to handle splitting yourself and don't come when busy!\n(Yelp 100 Challenge 13/100)"

There were a lot of choices on the menu and I decided on the farmer omelette with hash browns and toast. My hubby went for the chili omelette with biscuits and gravy. The portion size on my meal was great and on his it was huge! The food was very good but the standouts were the chili and the biscuits and gravy. I think I will be dreaming about the biscuits and I am not even a huge biscuit lover. The people next to us order French toast and eggs, and an omelette with pancakes. Again very generous portions. I would love to try the French toast that is made from homemade bread. Also homemade are all of the breads, buns, biscuits etc and the pies. All of this and a friendly staff. We will definitely be back so I can get my biscuit fix."

So I got some Brie too..and yep he shoved the Brie into the already nearly exploding brown bag...\nSo when I finally sat down for the very salty pie...I was put off and left it aside after a couple bites and looked at the crackers they gave me.

    "text": "Anyone who knows me knows how serious I take my BBQ. The problem with living in the far east valley is the lack of quality restaurants near by. Even with a dry cleaner, among other small mom and pop shops near by this place does a good job of drawing you in with the smoky and sweet smell of slow cooked meat. This is not your backyard grilled meats masquerading as BBQ after hiding under a overdose of super sweet sauce. No! this is meat the way it was meant to be cooked. Big hunks of meat cooked low and slow transforming into tender and juicy meat so good tasting you will wish you had three stomachs.\nLOL sorry kind of wandered off there for a minute but I'm back now. \nAnyways the place is set up very simply with small yet well spaced out tables each offering one of three kinds of sauce (sweet, mild, and I believe a hot version. Now I like sauce but had to say I was not a big fan of these. The owner seemed to have added Italian salad dressing to them as a way to add extra flavor. \nIn the past I have heard of others doing this but in this case it did nothing but add a weird after taste to the sauce. The hot version had a good kick but again had the same after taste issue. I recommend just forgoing their sauce altogether and just using one you have at home. Anyways moving on to the main attraction which is the meat. Others who have reviewed this place said it had a great smoky flavor and My texas brisket sandwich did not disappoint. \nThe meat was tender, had a good outside bark and smoke ring letting me know the person cooking this food knew what they were doing. As this was my first time here I just stuck to the meat (no sides this trip) but my friend has and thought the cole slaw was ok but was kind of watery. If you have a sweet tooth they also offer sweet treats like pecan pie and cookies. Overall I have to say the food I had was good and I do look forward to trying other menu items in the future. The prices may keep some people away but while you are going to pay more than you would for one of those fake BBQ Mc rib sandwiches I say it is more than worth it. Don't believe me then try it for yourself."

I have a nail in my tire!\" I decide to call Big O Tires the next morning to see if they can patch it. The customer servicer rep on the phone was very friendly and told me to come right in to have it looked at. Of course, they warned that they couldn't do it if it wasn't \"safe\". I have no idea what that means, but hey, it's worth a shot to fix the tire than buy a new one.\nThe next morning, I pump the tire back up, drove it in, and they got started right away. The technician took it off, patched it and put the whole thing back on 10 minutes tops. To make the whole experience even better, it was free! Fanastic! Turns out that it's a complimentary service that tires centers do in general, but it wasn't even a tire that I purchased from them! \nConclusion: They were quick, efficient and makes it better that the service came with a friendly smile."

I was expecting to dine here but it was much more similar to a diner experience were you get whammed bammed and thank you'd as we were in and out in a jiffy.\nMy husband loves classic Italian Foods and according to reviews Christo's seemed like a top destination. Honestly in general the food was OK but not great and nothing I'd drive out of my way for. I almost never consider service as part of my review since it varies all the time everywhere but in this case it sort of even lessened the experience so MUCH that I have to consider it otherwise I would have given Christo's three stars.\nOur waiter quickly greats us and ask if we want the menu or the restaurant week special. Despite being around 70 years old he was very quick talking and very speedy and sort of made us nervous but what really bothered me the most was him and his helpers standing there not to far from us with his arms crossed just watching us like a hawk eating the whole time. \nNow the food.\nI started with a Christo's Caesar Salad. I could tell the dressing was house made as well as the croutons. The dressing wasn't properly emulsified nor was it balanced in flavors and was super heavy with lemon. The croutons were crisp and buttery. I pointed out the faults since I know them but it really was an OK salad. I do note I wasn't offered fresh ground pepper, nicer restaurants do offer fresh ground pepper for Caesar Salads.\nI was sort of excited to have the classic dish Sole Meuniere here. The Christo's Version is nontraditional as the fish seemed heavily coated (maybe battered not sure) with flour in a lemon white wine sauce in stead of a traditional lightly floured and prepared in browned butter. The fresh spinach on the side was just plain without anything on it. \nDesserts seemed house made and were OK. We both liked the lemon cake better over the mousse.\nA glass of house wine was included with our dinners and during the meal we finished it and my husband ordered another round. He noticed a price difference from the menu and questioned our server. The server confirmed it wasn't the same price as the menu and said that for restaurant week they up charge the wine. It was only a few dollars but I feel this is bad business and not good for customer relations.\nI was really torn between two and three stars but the surprise of the wine up charge, being really rushed though dinner and with the waiter and his help all standing across from us just watching us the whole time in a unprofessional way sort of spoiled the dining experience.\n2.5 Stars"

But minor acts of meanness aside, this store is great for Asian cooking. It has masses of rice and noodles, sauces, spices, obscure jars of stuff I couldn't even begin to describe but look tasty, seaweed, Asian soft drinks...you name it they have it. There is a huge amount of Super Noodle equivalents as well, with much more interesting flavours; as these are often a staple student meal, I thought it would be important to mention them here. The owner is cool as well, when you can find him hidden in the surprising amount of aisles in the store. He is helpful and shows you where everything is, which is more of a challenge that you'd expect.\nThe prices here are definitely more expensive than your standard supermarkets but the food is much better. Also you would be surprised how long much of it lasts you, even if you use it frequently. To be honest I would prefer to give my money to the owner of a shop like this than to Tesco for inferior food that doesn't taste anywhere near as good."

    "text": "I've been here twice since my last review and both experiences have been great. I'm guessing it's because I never got that server/bartender guy from my first visit again. Yesterday I came for afternoon tea with a friend and we got the Champagne Cream Tea which comes with tea service, scones, cream jam, finger sandwiches, pastries\nand a glass of champagne. I actually had two glasses of tasty champagne because my friend is allergic, so I think that made my experience even better ;)\nThe portions that you get for your $25 are actually pretty big compared to other afternoon tea services in town. Each person gets a glass of champagne, 6 little sandwich triangles, 2 large scones, and 3 mini desserts. It took about 15 minutes for them to bring out the 3 tier tea stand with the goodies, so we just drank our tea during that time. I knew from my previous two visits I had to drink it fast because all the tea leaves (and there's a lot of them) are just floating in the pot and it doesn't get strained until you pour it into your cup, so it gets very bitter. After eating the sandwiches, which were a little dry, I was already feeling a little full, but I couldn't resist their delicious scones, cream, and jam. Their cream is homemade and so light and fluffy. My favorite mini dessert was probably the chocolate one with a hazelnut crunch. It tasted like Ferrero Rocher chocolates. \nOverall, I still have yet to come here for their regular menu, but so far I love their tea service and it's a great deal. I'm not big on their sandwiches though, so next time I'll probably stick to the Sussex Cream Tea service and mix that with some of the small bites on their happy hour menu which is around the same time as Afternoon tea."

My boyfriend was reluctant because all he could see were dollar signs, but soon after entering that subsided and we dove right into the bridal area of the store. \nWe were immediately greeted by an employee who took time to learn about our visit and our purpose for being there and he immediately began showing us around. They take you through all cases, case by case, and allow you to have three rings out at a time, making the process of elimination very easy. They also bring out the gem you desire within your price point to show you the full picture. \nUpon choosing the setting, they bring out several gems in your price point and educate you about them, so you choose the right one for you. If you happen to find your perfect ring, they have great payment methods including layaway, financing, or full cash. \nThe staff is super friendly and excited for you. The ambiance is great, they don't miss a beat here. Even showing you your ring under natural lighting, fluorescent, and LED to get the full picture. \nLOVE THIS PLACE!"

They have good opening hours and it's a nice casual cafe to kick back and relax after a day of activities, gambling, drinking or an all nighter ... \nHowever, because this is in the prime spot of Las Vegas i.e. Venetian and it's right by the entrance and one of the only cafes in Venetian serving this type of food, this place gets extremely packed, extremely fast! I came here for lunch at 11 am and it was already overly bustling with people, waiters and plates and forks everywhere. They have the hugest most extensive menu of any cafe I've seen yet and all of it comes out looking delicious and tastes so as well.\nI had a chance to have a go at their breakfast menu and it's great, they do serve some breakfast items all day but also have a specialty breakfast portion until 11 am. Great place to stop by for some variety in Vegas that's casual and comforting aside from the terrible service."

I gave my name to the hostess and was given a pager. 25 minutes later, I approached the hostess area and asked how long. I was told we we be next, but it would be 10 to 15 minutes. I go back to the hostess' again and was told they are clearing a table. 15 minutes go by and I again talk to the hostess (she was quite snooty and more concerned with watching the ASU football game) and she checked with her fellow hostess' on their paper logs to see where we were for check in. I was told my name and the pager were not accounted for and that they would clear a table right away. It took another 10 minutes and we were seated. One of the hostess' must of contacted one of the managers (thank you to her). A very nice manager offered 2 free appetizers for our wait (a nice gesture). I told the manager that we did not even get an apology from any of the hostess' and that they should have better customer service. Next, we waited another 7 to 10 minutes for our server (I believe her name to be Rebekah). She was impatient and quite rude off the top. We ordered our drinks and she was off. During that time, the manager who spoke to us earlier, told her of our extended wait and her attitude suddenly changed, mainly to please her boss more than the customer. We ordered, my wife's meal came out as a kid's order. They made a new order for us to take home. We ate, celebrated my wife's birthday and vowed we would not return. Poor, poor customer service for a place I liked. Yes, a place like this gets packed, especially when local sports are playing, but each customer that walks through those doors should be treated well. I should have stiffed them on the tip, but I did not. A horrible experience."

Nothing really stood out about this store, extremly plain with little to no product displayed. All the packaging for phone chargers,cases,etc was terribly dusty and it made the minutes it took for the guy to find her what she wanted feel like years. He seemed nice, however she did say she felt pressured to buy right away. Seeing as she was going to buy anyways, it didnt effect her decision to much. We were in and out fairly quickly as there was nobody in there except for five yellow shirts. Maybe one of them should dust? over all easy shopping experience for out of town people, due to low foot traffic and multiple task-less employees."

    "text": "I am going to give Bernard's 4 stars because the service and ambiance helped make the night a great one. We were staying at Ravella and came across this as we walked through the Village. The menu looked intriguing (French with a California twist mostly), they had someone playing the piano and it looked busy so we thought it might be a good choice for dinner. When we first entered the buser/hostperson gave us the impression there would be a wait for a table but then another buser came to our rescue and offered up a very nice \"reserved\" table in the corner near the piano. \nWe ordered 2 glasses of wine and the bus person returned with a newly opened bottled and poured the glasses right at the table (he was heavy handed with his pour so it was like a serving and 1/2 which is always nice ;-)...) For a starter we shared the Grilled Artichoke which was served with a very nice balsamic vinegar drizzle. The artichoke was good but not great, it needed to be drained a little more before it was put onto the grill. When you pulled the leaves off they had excess water coming off of them and it was annoying not to mention it almost dripped all over my shirt. For dinner we had the Chicken Mille Feuilles and the Filet Mignon based on Roger's recommendation and both dishes were very good. It did seem like the chicken dish had twice as much food on the plate as the filet dish but we were both happy with our meals. The only negative to the meal was the veg on the side was barely warm when the plate came out. Roger and the rest of the team did a great job of interacting at the table and making you feel like your business was truly valued by the team. At the end of our meal Chef Bernard made rounds through the dining room and great each table.\nOverall our unplanned, suprise valentines dinner was enjoyable and I know we want to go back to try the lunch/brunch since we are fans of quiche next time we are out at Lake Las Vegas."

And if you do can you make it so that you accept plastic?\nThe park itself though is gorgeous! There's plenty to do from the climbing wall, high ropes courses, hiking/biking trails, flat water paddling, and of course whitewater rafting. I signed up for a 3 hour high ropes course and it included zip lines, some teamwork challenges, more zip lines, some tightrope walking, and was led by a very knowledgeable and fun instructor. I had so much fun that time just flew by and 3 hours was gone before I knew it! I'll have to sign up for an all day course next time.\nThis is pretty much the only park of it's kind in Charlotte, and if you haven't been you really should check it out, just make sure you bring some cash for parking."

My initial thought was 'oh dear, another trendy spot that never lives up to the hype\". And with it's wall menu and counter ordering, it is a trendy. But there are several points that clearly raise the comfort level. \nBetween the wall of windows and bright lighting there is an airy feel to the place. The drink bar in the center of the room is a five-star bonus IMO. Yes, I have been accused of being a control freak in the past (and they say it like it's a bad thing...) but I love being able to create the perfect cup of coffee, suited for my tastes and mine alone. The tables, while very close together are always serviced immediately to accommodate the constant inflow of patrons. And even though the place always seems to be brimming to the rim, I have never felt rushed through either my meal or my paper. I also love the various selections on the flat screens that encircle the room. There is literally something for everyone (and how many people can actually say that they shared their yogurt parfait with Ed Begley Jr. on GTV?!!). \nNow for the food. I've been enough times to have sampled quite a few offerings and have even begun to create a list of favorites. On the top of that favorite list is the Gringo-Cherrywood bacon, egg & cheddar cheese Breakfast Burrito. This thing is large enough for two, or a second meal and is literally stuffed full of the perfect balance of egg, meat, and cheese! Ask for extra salsa, because one cup is not nearly enough for this big boy!!! The Brizzas (breakfast pizzas) and French Toast (baguette slices dipped in vanilla custard) are also tops on my list. As far as sides go, the Scramble Hash Browns are a must have! They seem to take a little longer to make and are really more of a hash brown/bacon/cheese tart-lette which are browned to perfection. I have literally had to defend mine from incoming utensils and believe that a quick thrust of the fork to the back of the offenders hand is quite an effective technique... \nMy only real criticism of the place is that if you have placed separate orders, your food may not be served at the same time. But this is so minor in comparison to the quality and the fact that clearly everything is made to order (not pre-done and waiting to be placed on a plate), that I can't really hold this against them. Then again, it may simply be that I have an addiction to those hash brown cakes! ; ) \nOn-line ordering is coming to their website and that will add an additional level of love for this place. \nThis is a welcome addition to the breakfast scene and if you are in need of some flavorful morning num-nums, Scramble on over!"

There's typical breakfast fare here with some dishes that have a Tex Mex/Mexican influence and there are also dishes like waffles and bagels. Nothing looked like it took a tremendous amount of effort to make and while I waited about 15 mins for a bagel and lox, I somehow managed to think that it took a while to prep the order because the bagel was locally made or made in house. But everything on the plate was something bought at a local grocery store. So I was a little disappointed because for the price I paid, I could have had 3 bagels and lox at home.

I don't think I have done more than walk through the place a few times since. But when I returned for noodle soup (read Pho at the Coffee Shop review) I saw a $5 craps table on my way out. I stopped to play a while with the light morning crowd.\nThe dealers were friendly and fun and everyone was having a good time playing the game. I think that is all you can ask for in a casino. I also like the feature bet. While I'm sure it's a sucker bet the 176 to 1 odds can make one happy sucker. I will return to play craps here and eat soup. Good Luck."

I think the staff struggle to understand what I am looking for sometimes, but they are super helpful!1st time I went in here I spent about 30mins just wondering around looking at all the mental stuff they had.... like the poster below I am vegetarian too, so I had to try all the crazy mock meat (fake duck anyone?) & almost every time I go I come out with something new to try. Prices are good, they offer a small student discount too (5%, but every little helps!) . A couple of times i've been they have run out of the one thing I am after but usually they are well stocked in most of their items!

They were delicious! Just enough batter without overpowering the pickle. We also each had a pint of their own beer, barrel grille beer (I don't think they brew just throw their label on it) which was great as well. Our waiter didn't know much about it but it seemed to my wife and I as a amber styled lager.\nFor dinner I had the country friend steak. The portion was huge however it was so salty it was close to inedible. It wasn't so salty that I would send it back but to salty for both my wife and I. I dunno maybe we are both just shy about sending stuff back. Anyway, with it I had some spicy mac and cheese which also was no good. It was bland and watery with barely a hint of cheese in there. Also had the green beans and almonds which was good, hard to screw up beans and almonds though!\nMy wife had the cowboy tacos which she said was good but thought it was overpriced. 15 bucks gets you 3 little tacos and a side of beans. \nSo there you have it. I gave it a 3 because while the food was so so, the service was great and I liked the ambience. Probably wouldn't go back just due to the fact there are too many other places similar to this one who can make the food more to my liking."

It sure hit the spot with atmosphere similar to El Gaucho but with a more contemporary twist. The space is warmed up by a modern fireplace and beautiful crystal chandeliers. \nService was impeccable. This gentleman made my mouth water every time he described a dish, a cut of meat, or the house specials. He knew every ingredient and did not hesitate to offer a complimenting martini or a glass of wine. Attentive just enough and engaging.\nTalk about a proper steak: Hank's cuts are all prime and hand cut, with grass fed options available as well. Our dinner consisted of the following:\n - Carpaccio of beef: always one of my favorites, the meat plays center stage, with just a touch of good olive oil, capers and micro greens.\n - Petite Filet: prepared Rare plus, ahmazing, the steak melted in my mouth, it was accentuated by just a touch of salt and pepper, so I could really taste the flavor and texture of this cut. A little bit of peppercorn sauce on the side.\n - Steamed asparagus: bottom half of the stalks are shaved for perfect tenderness.\n - Rotisserie Chicken: This is a whole chicken. Crispy, seasoned skin and juicy flesh all around.\n - Mashed potatoes: super creamy, with a touch of garlic.\nCucumber martini was a fresh start to the meal, followed by a glass of malbec.\nDelightful experience from start to finish.

First I totally agree with previous reviews that complain about the location of the TVs. They are in such awkward spots and are only tuned to like two different things, which is semi-annoying. However I can't complain too much when one of them is tuned to Sportscenter which is all I really need as I eat my lunch. My major complaint about Majerle's is that it is a very awkward space. There is a hostess stand out front on the sidewalk but no one is ever there, so you have to walk in and then BAM you are like on top of the bar. So you're in the way while waiting for a hostess which I hate.\nOther than that main complaint, I'm not going to hate too much on the food. It's a freaking sports bar. They serve sports bar food. I am not expecting five star cuisine...I just fried goodness that will clog up my ateries and beer on tap. If they have a salad or two so I can feel better about myself, great. For the most part everything I have tried has been good, including the potato skins, grilled chicken caesar wrap, fried chicken salad, kids grilled cheese meal (hey I wasn't hungry that day!) and the house salad. The french fries are really good especially dipped in ranch. The only thing I didn't really like that I have tried has been the chicken tenders. Something about them was just a bit off to me. Prices are decent considering the proximity to US Airways Arena and Chase Field.\nOverall a good lunch spot to grab a beer and get my sports fix, but not somewhere that warrants a special trip. I'll have to check it out before a game sometime to get the full effect."

The store is wall-to-wall used books, CDs, tapes, records, DVDs, VHS, magazines, computer games, console games, electronics, comics, etc. It's everything one should expect from their used media store. Looking for your used music store to have a guy in a tie-dyed shirt? Check. A punk rock chica with tat sleeves and cool piercings? Check. A section of the store dedicated vinyl? Check. NES and Sega Genesis carts? Check.\nWhenever I've gone to Bookmans, it's been a beehive of activity. A surprising number of people are always browsing, buying, selling, trading, etc. This is part of the reason I give Bookmans only four stars. As a victim of their own success, Bookmans is always slightly in disarray and that the staff overwhelmed by customers to the point that they can't restore order, e.g. it always seems like some idiot has decided to dump all the CDs he couldn't afford into A \"Pop\" and not a trip has gone by where I haven't found fiction books in just about every other sections of the store. There is almost always a line to pay and if you have a large box of things to trade on the weekend, it's going to take a while for them to review it. I think of this as my time to browse, but I have to make sure I'm planning on spending an hour or more in the store.\nAll that being said, the staff is the best I've ever seen in a store of this type (especially considering it's largiosity) the prices for buying, selling and trading always seem to be reasonable (especially when the alternative is putting a lot of time and effort into eBay) and the return policy is one of the most liberal I've seen in the business (especially in this day and age when CDs are so easily ripped to computer).\nOh... and although I've never seen a customer using it... they have free wi-fi."

I don't think I have ever seen a club this small, it's gotta be less than 2500 square feet. The decor is nice and the set-up is decent, but it gets very packed very quickly. \nThe DJ though... my god. I don't think I have ever been so bored at a club in my life, and I wasn't the only one because NO ONE was dancing. I guess since it was a pre-opening that the crowd just did not care to have a good time which is not the fault of the club but the music definitely could have given it a boost. I wanted to dance but the music was terrible to get my groove on to. \nI don't think I would come here when it is fully open - maybe to the beach, but not this club.

From the decor to the food to the staff, everything about this place has made me a regular customer. Not somewhere you want to go if you're super-picky (you know who you are, \"I wanna substitute everything\" folks), but if you've got working taste buds, you are in for a treat. I had the Apocalypse Sow burger..... *drool* The french fries are some of the best I've had. My 2 year old loved the grilled cheese sandwich and (aside from the lack of a changing table in the bathroom), it was super family-friendly. They've got a bar set off to the side with two flatscreens to watch the games, and their drink menu is twice the size of their dinner menu, haha. Add a sweet side patio for outdoor dining, and it couldn't get much better than this!"

So listen up because today was just ridiculous...... again. \nEvery Saturday is the same nightmare at this Starbucks store. Not just once in a while, but every time I have been in there. My gym, LVAC, is located there and I go on Saturday mornings for Zumba and afterwards I get a Greek yogurt with honey and granola. This store just finished construction making it 2 or 3 times as big as it was. But I ask you WHY? Management is inept and unable to lead or schedule shifts and has never been able to staff this store correctly. There is always a long, looooooong wait. Not necessarily because of a long line either. There are never enough people working EVER at any time that I have been in there over the past 3 or more years. It pisses me off when I see one person behind the counter taking orders and then fulfilling the orders. That means, if the customer at the register orders five sandwiches, heated, with five drinks and a pound of coffee ground finely please, you're screwed for a good 10 minutes. That's absurd! That's money lost! Bar-backs people! There should be two people behind the counter at all times that do nothing but fulfill orders. PERIOD. This location needs to send in secret shoppers to see just how much money this store is losing because of poor staffing and management. Hand over fist I tell you! There is no sense of urgency to sell and this team does not work together. People going on breaks when there are 10 people in line is bad management, bad scheduling and bad for business. \nSomeone needs to get upper management involved toute suite. Or ask me, a dedicated customer, how to streamline your operation to work for ME. You heard me........."

Now we wait annnnd wait and wait, we start to notice customers coming in after us and signing up, then a regular at matts, well of course the regular their gets seated first we thought naww understandable its a regular! But soon our anger and frustration grew when customers after us that all were in 2's were being seated before by the oblivious waiter who seemed to ignore us and our name we finally stood up finally our fuses blew we pointed out our name and he simply shook his hand at an end table and said \"oh you can take that one\" , EXCUSE ME? You know what forget it , we walked out, we gave Matts 3 chances! 1...2....3....UR OUT! good riddance to horrible waiters generic breakfast where we always leave saying \"couldnt we have made this at home?\", fellow yelpers I don't know about you but I rather take my business elsewhere, I also want to thank the breakfastclub for instantly sitting us down and serving an amazing breakfast!

The suite was HUGE, with a very large bathroom that had a separate soaking tub and large glass shower. It had a door to the toilet, double sinks, and a separate sit down vanity with a lighted mirror. And speaking of mirrors, there were also full size mirrors on the bathroom door and against the entry wall. As you walk further into the room you had a bedroom area with two steps down to the huge living room with a sectional sofa, and a desk that had a scanner/printer. My view was of the mountains. The lighting was fantastic, especially for a hotel room, and I loved the remote control sheers and blackout drapes. The room had 3!! count em 3! TV's. I loved staying in this room.\nThe only reason I didn't give it a 5 was the service at check in and check out seemed very harried...as if the person wanted to get rid of me as soon as possible. This happened when I checked in, and when I called to check out. C'mon, you can take an extra 30 seconds to pretend like you value me personally.\nThe property itself is beautiful, with painted ceilings, coffered ceiling in the casino, and a very nice smell. The only time I ever smelled cigarette smoke was when I was sitting right next to someone who was smoking."

You always know you're going to get tasty food, and a large serving (usually enough to share or take home half). Plus, they've got a huge menu with a good number of veggie options (veggie burger, salads, pastas, sandwiches, etc).\nI love love love their avocado eggrolls. So much deliciousness wrapped in wonton skins and then fried, with a yummy cilantro sauce. MMMM. Their corn cakes are also good, but the sauces on them aren't veggie; just ask for salsa instead.\nI also love the brown bread they serve with all meals, even if you're just getting starters or cheesecake. Speaking of which, they're actually pretty good, says my cheesecake snob partner (who is from NY), and big enough to share easily.\nI've actually been over-serviced at multiple cheesecake locations, which I guess is better than not getting enough. On NYE, we went here for Cheesecake, drinks and the free champagne toast; we had two almost identical servers who clearly didn't communicate, and the two of us wound up with four classes of bubbly instead of two. I'm not gonna argue.\nThey may have their off days for service, but their food is good, their menu long, and their servings big. It's hard to argue with that."

    "text": "Ok my husband is vegetarian and our daughter and I are vegan. I would have loved to give this place higher stars because we loved the food. The food was fresh, innovative and very flavorful. The chef was clearly very passionate about her food and it was reflected in her dishes. Beautiful presentation and delicious. The reason I feel unable to give them more stars are a couple of minor things. First the menu's were very confusing. They handed us three menus and it was overwhelming to read through them and figure out what to order. The kitchen was out of at least 25% of the menu which was confusing when we were sat down. My other beef is that they charge for literally everything. They have their dishes as is on the menu, and then they push to upsale you on extra's such as onions, salsas, sauces. The chef even came out and stated how a sandwich would be amazing with certain added ingredients. The prices were already a bit steep and then with any with additions, you can very easily take a $12 sandwich and pay close to $18 for a sandwich! The way I feel is for the price, make the sandwich with all of those ingredients and allow the customer to omit, versus add and pay the cost for it. The staff continued to suggest trying sauces and salsas with our food and my husband unknowingly agreed until I warned him that they were all $2 each time. We had $10 of extras to our bill :( Otherwise, fun and interesting vegan food. Worth the drive off the strip to find it. I just feel they need to lay off the upsale, it felt a bit like a car salesman. IF they insist of charging $2 for these extra's, make them decent portions and not these tiny little cups that can barely cover a full sandwich."

    "text": "I ended up eating at this place by chance. It happened to be located in the same small plaza as a couple of my other favorite eateries: Panera and Chipotle. I pulled into the parking lot with the intention of eating at Panera, but because of the small concentration of popular establishments, there was no parking available directly in front of Panera. So I found myself parked in front of a place called the Market Grille Cafe, advertising Greek and Mediterranean food. Mmmm, I thought, that sounds good. And in I went.\nIt's a similar style eatery as Panera. You order and pay at the counter, and then you take a number and find your own table and sit down to wait for someone to bring you the food. I liked the fact that Greek music was playing over the speakers. It provided an authentic feel.\nIf I had not been determined to stick to my vegetarian and fish diet, I would have ordered the herb roasted chicken and potatoes, because that sounds truly awesome, but instead I ordered a veg-a-nini ($6.95) and a small village greek salad ($5.95). The veg-a-nini was served and cut like a miniature pizza on pita bread. The toppings included spinach-basil pesto, chopped kalamata olives, grilled red onions, and crumbled feta cheese. It was light and flavorful.\nThe only difference between the regular greek salad and the village greek salad is that the village greek salad contains no romaine lettuce. I have nothing against romaine lettuce (in fact, I love it), but authentic greek salads don't contain any lettuce, and I thought this would be a rare opportunity to enjoy an authentic greek salad. Alas, while the ingredients were authentic, the cucumber and tomatoes were served diced rather than sliced and in wedges. The feta was also crumbled rather than served in chunks or in a large slice atop the salad. Unfortunately, the way the ingredients are prepared and served changes the experience of the flavors and taste of the dish. It still tasted good, but not as delicious as an authentic presentation would have been. If I had known that the tomatoes and cucumber would be diced, I would have ordered the regular greek salad with the romaine lettuce for the same price, although I fear the romaine lettuce might be served shredded.\nBefore I left, I ordered baklava to go. A generous portion of this sweet nutty dessert is $4.75. I enjoyed it.\nBased on the overall menu and my expectations, I really wanted to give this place four stars. Based on my experience, I can only give it three."

No tasting menu this time now that my husband and I have lost 120lbs together and are just eating differently. So, we were a tad more conservative, but still splurged and left with our bellies full. \nWe split the lobster bisque to start, which was good, but cannot compare to Kokomo's (which is now closed to make room for Tom's Heritage Steak BOO). I didn't like the large pieces of tarragon on top, which feels like chewing on pieces of grass, but it was tolerable. The lobster was nice and tender.\nFor dinner we split the 10oz filet, the potato puree and the risotto. This was still so much food! The risotto was made with butternut squash and prosciutto and was so rich and creamy and really wonderful. I know this is what properly made risotto tastes like and how easy it can be to get it wrong. The puree and filet were absolute heaven.\nFor dessert we ordered the pumpkin cheesecake and I was pretty disappointed. It was a small circle of mushy pumpkin with a vanilla cream of some kind on top of it. I hate to say it, but Cheesecake Factory cheescake was better than this stuff. Major bummer, thus the deletion of a star. When you pay $15 for dessert at a place like this, you want to shove your face it in and eat 15 of them, not just pick at it and wish it were more like at a chain where you hate their food."

    "text": "I came here twice for yoga on a recent visit to Montreal. Sangha is conveniently located just steps from Sherbrooke station and feels like an urban oasis. The facilities are news, super-clean, and very calming. There are 2 spacious studios - 1 on the main level, 1 upstairs. The reception area includes a small smoothie and snack bar where they serve complimentary tea. There is also a small boutique with yoga wear, mats, DVD's, books, etc. I found the service very friendly, even to an anglophone with just passable French. Zero attitude and it was fun to practice my French. Changerooms are really nice and spa-like, with one shower and lots of lockers (but you need to bring your own lock). They can provide towels at the reception area, although I don't know if there's a charge for that. \nThey have a busy schedule of several classes daily, so it's great because there's so much to choose from. I took the Hatha class on Saturday with Josianne and really enjoyed it. Although it was entirely in French, I could follow along (I agree with Velma - the amount of French you need is inversely proportional to how much background you have in yoga). Josianne was a patient teacher with attention to detail. I also tried the Shakti Flow class on Sunday with Marjorie. I didn't really enjoy it as much, but that was partly my own misunderstanding of what the class would be. I usually do Ashtanga and i thought it would be a similar flow or vinyasa-type class. Shakti flow is actually more like Nia, fusing some aspects of yoga with pilates or dance. There was a lot of hip circles and waving our arms with our eyes closed, and it wasn't much of a workout for me. \nIt is expensive at $18/class, but I got the $20 weekly pass for newbies so that wasn't so bad. Mat rentals are $2. They also have a clinic in the basement for massages and other treatments. \nI would come back for yoga next time I am in Montreal, but I would stick to Hatha or Vinyasa classes instead of Shakti!"

Not because I was charged for something I didn't get but because for the amount we paid we could've gotten the French market buffet next door all day pass.

I liked a lot of stuff, but I also thought to myself, do I really need this? numerous times. \nI'd say you can definitely find some cool holiday gifts or stocking stuffers here and hey it's fun to just walk around and gawk at the hoards of containers, hangers, drapes, chairs, decorative things The Container Store thrives on."

My usual Fabulous Freddy's takes a little longer for a car clean and wash, but at least the job is perfecto. \nSome Pros:\n-Close to one of my gyms. I can get me car washed or detailed while I shed some pounds. \n-Close to Rachel's Kitchen. I can get my eat on while they clean my car\n-Quick: One of the quicker car washes I've been to. The Freddy's I usually go to takes a long time for your car to get cleaned. I've even waited as much as 45 minutes for a regular detail. Here you get your car back with the quickness. \nSome Cons:\n-The detail wasn't as good as the other Fabulous Freddy's. Outside was fine, inside needed a little work. I was in a rush on my most recent visit so I finished what they didn't when I got home. \n-No real lobby. There's outside seating to wait for your ride and a makeshift lobby between the coolers and chips. Not much comfort inside in my opinion. \nI'm not saying I won't come back.

She seemed very distracted and it took her about five minutes to even notice that we were there. Once we were seated it took probably another ten minutes before anyone ever took our drink order or introduced themselves. Eventually a woman came over, I still do not know her name because she did not introduce herself and she said she was a manager and would be taking our order because our server was running behind.\nI ordered the penne with marinara and alfredo sauce with chicken which was a recommendation from the manager that took our order. My fiance had the lasagna. It took about fifteen minutes for our food to come out which wasn't bad but it was horrible once we started eating. The chicken in my penne dish was rubbery and tasted freezer burned and days old. Definitely not cooked fresh. The lasagna that my fiance had seemed like something that had been frozen for months and then quickly heated up in the microwave. I wanted to send my dish back but once again there was no server to be found. My fiance had to eventually ask the bartender to find a manager. Ten minutes later we finally had someone over to our table. I told her that the chicken was really bad and that I would like something else. I ended up just getting the garlic and brown butter sauce on spaghetti. It was not to bad but pretty bland and nothing to write home about. Overall the service was really lacking and the food was terrible. The only thing that I enjoyed was the Italian cream soda and the bread which isn't saying much.\nI would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. If you are around Chandler Mall waiting to see a movie, go to BJ's or California Pizza Kitchen. Much better service and food."

And for $7, it's reasonably priced. \nThe seating area wasn't too packed when I was there, but I can see how it would get crazy packed if there's a long line. It's self-seating so if it gets too packed, you can always have a friend save a table while you order! \nI finished the other half of my sandwich a few hours later.

After you eat one taco you'll want like ten more so just do yourself a favor and order the burrito with extra green sauce. I should have listened to the big guy. \nThe two fish tacos were served in one dish and even though I ordered one for me and one for my dad I never got the pleasure of trying that delicious taco treat because my dad ate them both!

Havana Grill might not be as good as what I would eat at a childhood friend's house, but it was tasty. The rice was flavorful without being too salty or overly seasoned. The chicken was moist and fall off the bone tender. The plantains were cooked to perfection. The three pieces were soft, sweet, and not dried out. There have been many times where I go to a Cuban restaurant to be disappointed in finding that their plantains have the consistency of Styrofoam. The plates are large and can easily feed two people. I ordered this with a side of the steamed yucca. Yucca is a root vegetable that is mellow in flavor. It could have used some citrus to make it taste bolder. The onions on top adds a nice contrast in texture. So far, Havana Grill serves one of the better arroz con pollo I have had in a restaurant. My friend had ordered the chicken simmered in red wine with potatoes and olives. This was the better dish of the two. Served with black beans and rice, it is a great deal at $12."

I nearly lost my mind...I moved closer to the stage, breaking my winning streak at the Blackjack table so I could get a better look. Oh..My...God..I was completely blown away by how well he got down Prince's mannerisms, stage presence and even his voice down. It was freakin' amazing. This guy is extremely talented in his own right, but dayum, I mean, I have seen Prince live and this guy could perform right next to him..seriously. It was like watching the real thing.

I would say, his version of Prince would span from the Purple Rain era to say..errrm \"The Most Beautiful Girl In the World\" era around 1994 or so.\nTo sum it up, this show should not be missed.\n They are now playing at the House of Blues at Mandalay Bay on Sunday nights and they also have a version of The Time that performs with them as well who are also pretty freakin' good. Now, all they need is to add a Sheila E impersonator and we are golden. I will be heading back to Las Vegas in October so, of course this where you'll know to find me on Sunday nights.

The corn was off the cob and grilled to perfection. Topped with butter, cilantro, lime, and salt."

    "text": "Went to Pallets on a Friday night (4/12) excited at the prospect to 1) try out a new place in the arts district and 2) have a hot bowl of noodle soup. We got to choose where to sit on any of their 3 patios, and menus were handed out. A server came by and took our drink orders, a Pinot for me, and an IPA for a friend (originally wanted a Malbec but was told they were out, no big) oddly enough service stopped there.\nMy friend and I while waiting for our drink orders as well as perusing the menu overheard the next table over being told by their server that of the 50 items on the Vietnamese menu only 3 items remained. Hearing that my friend and I started to feel uneasy about our experience at the resto. As we sat unsure where to go to next, another server came by to assist us, it's interesting that our original server did not bother to bring our drink orders or assist us further (that's a star for that). I then asked the (second) server if what we had overheard was true and he confirmed that their whole Vietnamese section was out and then proceeded to tell us that we could still order from their Japanese section without batting an eye. That pretty much sealed the deal for us in which I replied that if I had an intention to get myself sushi that evening I could have done so by going to Moira around the corner (so that's another star off) and I must say that my overall experience was marred because of the dishonesty of their host staff for not being forthright with their limited menu and seating us (a star off for that) and finally who runs out of food?! I've been to quite a good number of very popular Vietnamese restos in Phoenix like Da Vang, Little Saigon, Saigon Pho to name a few and even during their really busy periods, not once have I been told they have run out of certain item (so another star off). I really wanted to give Pallets a chance that evening and had every intention to but I guess it wasn't meant to be. \nWill I give it another chance? I'm not sure about that."

Yes the taste was ok, but if I'd paid the regular price of $3.79 (!!) for it, this would be a 1-Star Review!\nAs for the restaurant itself, everything was fine. It has a comfortable dining room and the service was good.

We were buying more than 2 cupcakes, so I'm not sure what the problem was. I suppose they felt that it was better to take my money once rather than make me a repeat customer. Minus one star for crap service.\nThe cupcakes themselves were subpar. I've had amazing cupcakes from places like Georgetown Cupcake and Red Velvet, but these were just okay. Beautifully presented but one was WAY too buttery, one was very dry and the others were not spectacular. In fact, I've had a stomach ache all night since sampling. I have definitely made better at home. Minus 2 starts for bad cupcakes.\nSave your money, time and stomachs and go somewhere else."

The smell of rotisserie chicken makes my heart sing, anyway, but it was even better to eat. For around $8, I got an entire meal of rotisserie chicken, black beans, and spinach. I ordered spinach to be healthy (must have been sick or something) and was shocked at how good it tasted! Not to mention the chicken...\nThis place is very homely-located above a rowdy Karaoke bar. I applaud them for being so deliciously weird. A salsa bar (as in sauce for tortilla chips, not the music), collard greens, mac n cheese, and tico beans?

Even the fries tasted bad. \nMy Mom ordered the Southern Smokehouse Bacon Burger. Again, it looked really yummy and was huge, but was flavorless. She also said it was mushy in the middle and the ancho-chilie BBQ sauce was not on there at all!\nWhen the sever brought us our food we asked for a couple of sides of ranch for our fries. She said no problem. I ate half of my sandwich and had given up on the ranch and was using ketchup before we finally got our ranch. Both of our fries were cold by the time it came and then it wasn't even our server that brought it to us! \nChili's you disappointed me. From your servers to your food: meh! I feel I totally wasted my money and time! I should have just gone to Rachel's Kitchen where I know the food has taste and is yummy!"

To those people who don't want to bring 4 dollar cash, I know its a lot of money maybe bring an armored car? \n2. The bagette sandwich bread is crusty some call it \"hard\". Some people (me) like it that way. If you like soft bread stay away or get croissante sandwiche.\n3. Some of the baked goods are good. \n4. The sandwiches are inexpensive but don't have a huge amount of meat. Again I like this - just telling you."

    "text": "Second day in Vegas. Over-sized margaritas and cold beer are keeping my mind sane and calm, so many colors, sparkles, beautiful women, shows, bright lights, moving objects with sounds. Like any other simple boy, I am a sucker for these things.\nCan not drive the convertible obviously, the fuzz in my head is remarkable. It almost feels like, I am listening to Arabic hip-hop and wandering around a desert, lost and hopeless. Get a cab or a camel and go for dinner. I desperately in need of heavy protein intake. The cab line-up, reading the guide, saw a familiar name. Tom Colicchio. I like his TV personality, looks like a good guy. Don't think too much, hop on the good foot and do the bad thing. Here we go.\nThe restaurant is just beautiful, modern and relaxed. Friendly in a very sleek way which is a perfect set up for a steakhouse. Steakhouses should not be intimidating. Sat at the bar, you know what, let's do beer tonight and straight from the bottle. All classics are on the menu. Most of the items are 3 ingredients only. Good sign, very good sign. Bread rolls; six of them are jumping out of a Lodge's square iron cast pan, reaching up like flowers to the sun, hot, sweet, delicious. Personal favorite; Kushi oysters, small, succulent and creamy. Salad of caesar -must at a steak house-, high in acidity, so fresh, so appropriately done. All the fuzz is gone, I am surprised that everything is flawless, or I am very drunk. Wouldn't know.\n18 oz, bone-in rib-eye, medium, just because you would like the middle fat cooked through, so it melts on your palate. I usually cut out the cap and eat it separately. That little bit is incredibly flavorsome, should be savored on its own I believe. \nThere she comes, I watch her glide through the dining room on the arms of her handler - and thank god this time it is not a father-, I know she is mine, laying down as beautiful as can be on a oval copper pan, I can hear Etta James in the back of my mind, singing; ''At Last''.\nThe char, the crust, the seasoning, the doneness, no stupid garnishes, no games, NO PRE-CARVING (thank god!) in the kitchen. It is the finest steak I have ever had in a restaurant. I am about to burst into tears, I am pretty sure I am not drunk... It is so good, so good, so, so good. As I was dealing with all the emotions, my enthusiasm attracts attention, couple seat over an indistinct chatter; '' I want whatever he is having''. Halfway through this experience I realized I had mashed-potatoes or the potato puree as a side. The word ''puree'' is not clicking with me for some reason, reminds me of baby food or something whipped heavily because it is not presentable on its natural form. Anyway one fork in, I stalled.\nWhen you go to culinary school, in most of the classes, smoothness, shapes, colors, uniformity are more pronounced by the instructors instead of the actual flavor factor. That is why cooks are more obsessed with the doneness and composition rather than the flavor I think. This potato dish was bursting with the sweetness of a properly made mash. It is not as creamy or silky and nor it should be as you would find in other fine food establishments, but extraordinary. The starch of the potato is cooked through so there is no residue on your palate, it swallows very clean. Seasoning is perfect, and I mean perfect. I am overwhelmed, I can not take it anymore. I can not go back to other mashed potatoes! My whole take of mash is changed with my first bite. I suspect if they used fingerlings, it tastes so. I forgot about the steak already.\nAfter that day, I have changed the way I make mashed potatoes. I started cooking them in skins, peel hot, add appropriate amount of butter until the tightness of the mash is almost gone and emulsify with hot milk, season. Cream, screw cream, not only it dilutes the potato flavor, but it gives a thick body to the puree. I think smooth substances should be lightened up with liquids with low-viscosity, so they loose that gunky palate feel.\nI step out, completely transformed, happy, satisfied. Now I need an 32 oz margarita to wind down. Hands down it was one of the best meals I have ever had. \nThank you chef, this meal probably will be the only thing I remember clearly from a wild Vegas trip.\nOh, and the Spearmint Rhino. It was awesome too."

(that's what she said) My bro and I frequent this spot every time I make a trip to Las Vegas. It is an awesome place to pre-game before hitting the clubs. Everyone complains that it is expensive but you really just have to strategize. See what I do is find a table, buy a pitcher then have the opposing team by their pitcher. We commence playing then someone will come up asking who gets to play winner. I tell them you can as long as you buy the beer. Obviously this only works if you're good at pong cause if you lose you're S.O.L. \nI really like this place. It is a fun atmosphere and if you take my strategy you will be drunk for the price of only one pitcher. The only thing I would say kinda sucks is the parking structure is so sketchy and smells like piss. Also, it gets pretty slippery with all the idiots spilling beer so be cautious when walking around. Instead of water cups to \"clean\" the balls after they land on the floor they should use some sort of lysol.

When I'm craving bbq in the future, I'll be going back here. I'm looking forward to trying their burnt ends and french fries. \nI ordered the two meat platter with brisket, pulled pork, mac n cheese, and bbq beans. The bbq beans were more like the beans I'm used to (made with bbq sauce), not the cowboy beans you typically get in the valley. The mac n cheese seemed homemade, but it needed a bit of salt and pepper - I like pepper in my mac n cheese.\nThe brisket was deliciously smoky and had a perfect pink ring around the edge. It could have been more tender, but it was leaps and bounds better than the fatty, no flavor brisket I usually get out here. \nThe pulled pork was fantastic and it's not something I usually get. It was extremely moist, tender, and flavorful and there was no fat. \nThe presentation also reminded me of home with the two slices of white bread under the meat and pickles on the side. One of my favorite things about bbq is eating white bread soaked in sauce. \nUnfortunately, the only thing I didn't like was the bbq sauce, but that is a personal preference. All three of their sauces are sweet and I do not like sweet bbq sauce. I would have given them five stars if I liked their bbq sauce.\nI can't speak much to the service and ambiance because I ordered carry out.

As they walked around with the food, there were only 1 or 2 options that I didn't really care for because it was a bit dry for my tasting or too salty; however, the rest were fantastic! The lamb was my favorite, and I loved how their medium-rare steak was actually medium-rare! Melts right in your mouth (: The side dishes are also key factors: the rice and beans, sweet potato, etc... reminds me of Korean-style dining where the side dishes can be constantly refilled and they certainly add a great variety to dinner. \nOverall, I recommend this place. I will be trying more Brazilian steakhouses throughout the city that are perhaps more reasonably priced... but I can't bash on Samba for being a tad on the $$ side because it's located in a casino on the strip. Definitely check this place out as a tourist, or you're conveniently on the strip... just bring an empty stomach ;)"

The guy at the counter asked me if it was my first time there, and when I explained that it was, he took me to the side and let me sample 6 items off of the menu. He also explained how to order (which allows you to pick from 14 different meats and gives you the option of eatting them over rice, in a burrito, or in a quesadilla--all for the same cost). You also have the choice between black beans and refried beans. And you have the choice of 4 different types of fried rice. Finally the combos come with a free cookie. \nI ordered a combo with a carnitas burrito, red jade chicken over jerk fried rice, refried beans, and an oatmeal cookie. The red jade chicken really stands out here, and there is no question why it is the most popular item on the menu. The caritas were good as well as the rice. The beans were okay but nothing spectacular. Finally, the oatmeal cookie was surprising delicious.\nWhile I've had better food, this place definitely gives you a bang for your buck (my entire meal with a drink was about 10 dollars). The employees were also very nice. While this was my first visit, it will not be my last."

She absolutely loved her previous doggy daycare in New Hampshire, so I had high hopes for this place... BIG MISTAKE! \nI picked up my dog after she had spent the day there. As soon as we got home, I noticed she was bleeding on her arm. It looked like a couple scratches, but I didn't worry too much because dogs can be rough sometimes- no big deal!\n It wasn't until the next morning when I noticed her behavior was extremely odd. She was sitting in a corner for hours, whimpering a bit here and there. When I took her outside, I noticed she was having the hardest time walking down the stairs. She is barely 1 year old, so this was VERY abnormal. As we got to the yard, she began yelping very loudly. I thought maybe her harness was rubbing against the injury on her arm, but even when I took it off she was still yelping. She could barely walk back up the stairs. She is a 80 pound mastiff, so it was impossible for me to carry her up 3 flights of stairs. I felt so helpless!\nMy boyfriend immediately called Chandler Dogs to ask if she was in a dog fight or if anything out of the ordinary happened to her. The manager claimed he was there ALL day, but didn't know of anything that could have happened. \nThe absolute WORST part of this whole ordeal was that the MANAGER suggested my dog must have \"fallen\" on the way out of the facility (HA!) or that it might be a spider bite. What!? Since when does a spider bite look like bloody abrasions? If that isn't the most sketchy excuse I've ever heard, I don't know what is! He also claimed she might be acting different because she was in a crate after she got groomed. MY DOG IS CRATE TRAINED! These bizarre excuses just made me worry even more. \nBottom line: My poor baby was sore for about 4 days after, and I still have no clue what happened to her. I will NEVER bring her here again!"

I think if you haven't been to Share, it's definitely worth going at least once so you can take it all in, so to speak. It's one of the only nice gay clubs in Vegas and although you might be tempted to opt for Marquee or Tryst, sometimes, you just wanna gay it up. It's by no means anything fancy, but it isn't trashy either. Located just a short taxi ride away from the Strip (I think I paid around $12 from the Wynn), it's a good option if you want to let loose and be fabulous. Again as other Yelpers said, it's best to go with a group so you can have a good time.\n- Expect it to be kind of empty.\n- Expect some good dancy upbeat pop/hiphop music.\n- Expect the drinks to be around $10 (not bad for Vegas IMO)\n- Expect some hottie gay-for-pay dancers that will probably spend more time hitting on your hag than trying to get your attention.\n- Expect to awkwardly avoid sexual advances from the Vegas locals (they are aggressive and can bite, unless you like that)\n- Expect to be standing the entire time (because the empty seats are reserved for bottle service, which NO ONE is paying for)\n- Expect to leave happy you experienced it, but somewhat disappointed.\nThat's all folks!"

How can you go wrong with cheese and pastry? Scratch that, I just remembered the goat cheese I pulled out of my refrigerator the other day. You can go wrong, but they didn't. I also had the roasted beet salad with port wine braised figs and shallots. I loved the combination of flavors, but would have liked just a little more vinaigrette. For the entree, I chose the Crispy Pacific salmon fillet. I wouldn't say the salmon had anything special about it, except the crispy top. It's normally served with braised brussel sprouts which I opted out of. I had brussel sprouts once. I made them. I threw them all away. They were the most foul-tasting thing I ever had. I have since learned that happens when you overcook them. Who knew? Instead I substituted roasted asparagus. I was a little disappointed the asparagus was in pieces rather than whole stalks, but it was cooked perfectly. The toasted orzo that accompanied the salmon was fantastic, however.\nPrice-wise appetizers are $10-$12, salads $8-$9, and entrees $20-$30. Not bad at all. I should warn you, this isn't necessarily the place to go for beer. Nothing on tap, and when my husband ordered a second Stella, they were out. Kind of odd.\nAfter dinner, we had the wine and chocolate \"class.\" The pairings were all sparkling wines with white chocolate, milk chocolate, and dark chocolate. All plated desserts. The white chocolate was a petit four with a small cup of white hot chocolate. The milk chocolate was a semifreddo with truffles. The dark chocolate was an assortment of homemade candy bars. The restaurant manager introduced the wines and Chef Travis the desserts. A dark chocolate lover would have been disappointed as the chef admitted he is not a fan of dark chocolate and used only 52%. That was great for me because I don't care for it either. There was not much information regarding what characteristics in a wine make it pair well with a chocolate, but it was a great event nonetheless. \nI look forward to more good times at Avalon (1/2 price bottles of wine and live music on Wednesdays!)...hopefully, they will stay open. Again it was not busy, and this was a Friday night. I'm glad I went in spite of some suspicious orange-head reviews."

Here's the history lesson: dude named Babcock created the first ever dairy college at U-Dub. Years later, they name the building after him, and open up this retail ice cream establishment to make more money for the man.\nLuckily, their ice cream is good.\nWe arrived just before Semisonic (err, closing time) at a ridiculous 4pm. Apparently other people had the same idea. The wife and I each got a flavor, a single (which apparently means two scoops). I did the butter pecan on cake cone, which I'm a complete sucker for--the cake cone, not the butter pecan. It had just been a long while since I'd had butter pecan. The wife got the mint on waffle cone, which costs a little bit more. But it doesn't matter because the prices are so dirt cheap to begin with, anyway.\nIce cream when it's 25 degrees out doesn't sound like a good idea, but Babcock Hall's good stuff hit the right spot. It's ridiculously creamy, which I suppose was to be expected, this being dairyland after all. I prefer my ice cream on the lighter side--think gelato or Paris' great Berthillon. Then again, I'm a huge sucker for Blue Bell's amazingly good and amazingly creamy chocolate chip cookie dough. Long story short, if you're getting ice cream, it's a nice story to get it from Babcock Hall while car touring campus. Pretty good stuff, too."

That being said those two things plus a Guava nectar were $22 which I thought was a bit pricey. In any case - the chicharron was good. Good amount of crunch, right amount of meat and fat left on it. I thought it could have been seasoned a little better but they are probably just trying to tailor it to the American palette (which mine is not). So what is the deal with Arepas? They are just plain tasteless little corn meal patty things? I mean I like corn meal but they are white corn meal not even yellow so not much flavor? That being said they are soft and lovely to soak up 'other' flavors with just don't come with any flavor of their own. \nNow to the Bandeja Paisa.

In pieces:\nRice - perfect (no flavor but none needed as it had beans and an egg)\nSausage - started out feeling weird about it because the texture is weird it has meat chunks in it vs. ground stuff but it's SOOO flavorful and soon became my favorite part of the dish.\nBeans - They were OK. Our beans (Puerto Rican) have a lot of flavor and these were a little bland but not bad.\nSteak - thin and a bit dry - could have used more flavor again but not bad at all.\nEgg - over easy. \nYellow plantain - sweet and delicious - hard to mess this up\nChicarron - same as it was in the appetizer plate\nArepa - same\nOverall I enjoyed it - felt stuffed and enjoyed the new food experience.

The butter comes with a piece of processed cheese spread with grapes and cranberries. Very tasty!\nI started with a house salad that comes with all entrées. It's built almost like a small Cobb salad with greens in the middle and small mounds of diced tomato, bleu cheese, candied walnuts, hearts of palm, cucumber, and hard boiled egg around the perimeter. I got bleu cheese dressing and the salad was very good.\nMy main course was the 8 ounce filet done black and blue. With the steak came some summer vegetables cooked very little. They were crispy and they were good! I ordered a salted baked potato as a side. My steak was done perfectly and the baked potato with that rich salt was very, very good.\nFor dessert, I got the Canal Street bread pudding with blueberries and a Bourbon whiskey vanilla sauce. The bread pudding was different. Not only was there the vanilla sauce, but the bread had a distinct chocolate infusion and there was chocolate sauce along with the vanilla. Excellent.\nService was very good. Iced tea was refilled without asking, finished dishes were removed promptly, and there was adequate time between courses to relax and enjoy the surroundings. I wasn't rushed nor was service slow.\nI like the room. It has a New Orleans theme with one side being a mural. In about an hour's time, the lights on the mural slowly dim and the fluorescent paint starts to glow with the blue lights and it looks like the lights in the mansion along the river or on the paddle wheel boat were turned on.

Just the name of the place is novel or movie material. \nMy friend and I were the only non Bosnians in the place. Kind of hard to explain, but the place did have a mafia vibe to it. Maybe it's from excess Hollywood exposure, or maybe it's because I'm from NE Philadelphia where there definitely IS a mafia presence there, albeit Russian. \nI had the cevapi, and my friend had the patty version of it. Food is hot, fresh, and cooked on the spot. Their special bread is also baked fresh on the premises. The flavors are real simple and has a soul food feel to it regardless of what your ethnic background may be. We also enjoyed some imported sodas, bitter lemon soda and \"cockta\" (wonder why this didn't take off here?) which is a mix of coke and creme soda. \nTo top it off, the items are priced as if you were in a foreign country (where the dollar is actually above the local currency mind you)! Five bucks for a hot, fresh, cooked meal? That's fucking crazy, and in a way it captures some of that old world spy novel Cold War era nostalgia to it as well. \nI recommend coming to this place and trying it out, well worth the trip. Or, if you were scheduled to meet a contact and make a drop in the area, stop in for lunch. Just make sure to leave with a different briefcase than the one you came in with."

    "text": "The concept of this place is unique in Vegas. Basically, you've all heard it; boba girls serve you drinks in their lingerie. \nTheir service is impeccable. The girls are always smiling and friendly. I've been here 3 times and the service has been consistently great. They have board games to play. The girls sit down with you and chat as well as play board games with you. \nSo why the three stars you ask? Honestly, I really wanted to like this place because the people here are really kind and it's not like a typical boba shop. I came for boba, and it's just too overwhelming on sweetness and the price is way too expensive for a little serving of tea.\nThe first time I went I ordered a boba milk tea. Way too powdery and left a weird after taste in my mouth. I always compare milk tea to the ones I've had in Hong Kong and it just felt like powder that wasn't fully blended into the water. The second time, I ordered a flavored black tea, I can't remember if it was mango or passion fruit, I just remember something fruity. The tea taste is pretty good but I just can't handle all that sugar. I'd suggest going for black tea if you don't like it too sweet. The latest time I went I ordered a kumquat black tea. The tea was just too sweet once again. I expected it to be overly sour because it is a kumquat after all but once again I am having trouble with how sweet it is. \nI still come here because the service is good and to take first timers that want to go but it's really painful on the belly to suffer all that sugar. \nDon't be discouraged, I'd recommend checking it out at least once. If you like service, sweet drinks, and girls then you wouldn't have a problem here. But if you want the tea, I wouldn't come here for it."

    "text": "Roy's Liquor Store is a friendly, classy establishment on the corner of Hualapai/Desert Inn in south Summerlin. They offer a wide selection that includes craft beers, fine wine, premium sake, Don Pilar tequila, and high quality cigars. Roy is easy-going and knowledgeable.\nThe store is right next to Rachel's Kitchen, a gourmet café I love. I started dropping in whenever I needed a bottle of wine or sake. Along with the diverse selection, I noticed the cigar room, and though I'm not a cigar connoisseur, it looked too swank not to step into. The room is walled with cedar and equipped with humidifier to age and protect the cigars; there are hundreds to choose from; stacked high above the cigars are international-looking wood boxes. It smells fantastic, like you've stepped into a giant cedar cabinet. I imagined the \"Most Interesting Man in the World\" lighting a cigar and saying, \"I don't always smoke cigars, but when I do, I prefer Roy's.\"\nThere's more. Twice when I've dropped in he's had interesting, live tastings. First it was for Zing Vodka. The \"Red Velvet\" sample went down so smooth I bought two bottles. Having two gorgeous women selling it may have helped its case. The Zing bottles and glasses light up, too, creating their own festivity and allure as you drink. My friends enjoyed the Zing as well-the flavored version was easy to drink by itself, at room temperature.\nThen last Friday evening it was Don Pilar Tequila. Honestly I've never acquired a taste for tequila-until that moment. Even before drinking I noticed its golden, bright hue; then I could smell notes of toasty oak, fruit, and butterscotch. It tasted just like it smelled, plus a touch of pineapple, chocolate, and baked agave, then a warm slow finish of sweet oak. Suddenly I felt like the most interesting man in the world.\nNick Christie, who was helping with the tasting and manages the Don Pilar brand for Las Vegas, told me Roy's would be the only place in Las Vegas one could purchase Don Pilar Tequila. http://www.donpilar.com/\nIf all this wasn't enough, Roy takes pride in his work and store. The store is always well-stocked, clean, nicely lit, and Roy greets you with a smile. These are the places I prefer to take my business. I also appreciate what he had printed on the back of his business card: Please Drink Responsibly. Don't Drink and Drive.\nhttp://lasvegastoppicks.com/roys-liquor-store-wine-cigars/"

I arrived expecting to simply see a bunch of boobs swinging around for an hour or so, but the show ended up being so much more than that. \nThe intimate ampitheater-style venue is perfect for such a performance, as everyone gets a good view. There are a series of dancers, who come out for group or solo performances, but it's supplemented by a woman who has an absolutely amazing voice. I can't recall her name, but I wouldn't be surprised if she one day becomes a recording artist on a major record label, as she hits all kinds of notes, effortlessly! So there I was, enjoying the music, and the dancing, when another element was injected into the show....comedy. I truly wasn't expecting it, but it was a good surprise. The comedian not only told jokes, but also was an impersonator (James Brown, Sammy Davis Jr, Tina Turner, Michael Jackson), and worked his way into one or two of the acts with the dancers. \nThe combination of the music, dancers, costumes (or lack of), and comedy, created a great evening for me. And I'll mention, that I'm a gay man, and I thoroughly enjoyed this topless show, so it's definitely something for all adult audiences! Although the show is sexy, it's not sexual, if that makes sense. Anyway, it's worth checking out. Oh, and one last point, if you sit int he first couple of rows, you'll get a chance to have the singer and dancers come by and shake their boom booms in your face :)"

    "text": "For me the Golden Dragon was one of those places you drive by all the time for years, always thinking \"Man, I really need to try this place. There's always cars in the lot and they've been around forever!\" but inexplicably never do anything more than that. Well, after approximately 19 years I finally gave the Golden Dragon a try and it was...a valley Chinese restaurant.\nI've been on a mini-quest to find a suitable replacement for my former go-to neighborhood Chinese joint (the lamentable Pong Pong on West Bell Road) and so far, so-so. Therefore I was really hoping that my quest would end with this long pondered destination. I mean, hey, they have sizzling rice soup! That immediately scores a point of favor, right? So here's the rundown \nThe wife and I ordered takeout:\n-Szechuan beef\n-Orange chicken\n-Egg drop soup\n-Spring rolls\n-Crab puffs\n-Vegetable fried rice\nThe beef itself was good, tender and not over done. The sauce was typical brown spicy-ish gravy. Not overtly oily but commonly greasy. The chicken was of very good quality, the \"spicy\" orange sauce was prevalent but the taste was AWOL. \nOn a side note, why is that Chinese restaurants always denote the spicy dishes on the menu? In my experience, this merely means that a dried red pepper will be placed somewhere within the dish, rendering a few surrounding millimeters somewhat hotter than the rest. \nAny-hoo - The egg drop soup was all egg flour. That's it, not even a sliver of scallion. Not bad, but barren. The crab puffs were pretty good. Large, with a better than average filling that contained a fair portion of Krab™. The spring rolls were pretty terrible. Oilier than canned sardines and filled with a bland mixture of rice noodles and something that resembled the stuff that oozes out of the cyborgs in the Alien film series. The highlight was the veggie fried rice. Fluffy, savory, with generous amounts of fried egg and bean sprouts.\nAll and all...a valley Chinese restaurant. I think I might have to abandon my quest to replace my old favorite Chinese joint. Maybe it's not so much that I can't find something suitable, maybe it's more that I just don't really like Chinese/American food anymore. \n(Except for sizzling rice soup. Why didn't I get the sizzling rice soup? I haven't had the stuff in eons)"

I had the Shipwreck Burger, medium-rare, and he had a cheeseburger with ketchup and pickles, well-done, because he's a baby. \nAnywho, my burger was awesome -- they toast the buns on the griddle, which i love, plus it was oozing with Brie, caramelized onions, truffle oil, bacon, and I don't even recall what else. I just know it was fantastic. The buns are large enough to hold the fairly large patties, but they're nice and light, so you don't feel like you're eating more bread than meat and toppings. \nHowever, I must admit that when our food came, I didn't touch my burger for a few mins, because I was gobbling up the fries! Their fresh cut fries are phenomenal!!! I couldn't get enough. There's malt vinegar sitting on the counters, too, so I splashed some on. Love, love, love fries with vinegar.\nI also must note their awesome on-tap beer selection (I had a hard pear cider), and whiskey selection, of course. They had a bottle of double black Johnnie Walker, which we'd never seen before, and our waitress (Crushin' D) was so kind as to bring the bottle over for us to check out, she told us a bit about it, and she poured a li'l sample for my BF to taste. She was also just friendly and all-around knowledgable, which I always appreciate.\nThe space itself is pretty small, tight, and dark, but it totally works. It's the right ambiance for them! They do accept credit cards, and I saw a dude come in to pick up grub, so they do take-out too, which is good to know! \nAll in all, Winghart's deserves top marks, and I'll definitely be back for more."

Because there are two dance floors it made it comfortable for people to listen to whatever kind of music they want to listen to because there was a hip hop dance floor on the bottom floor and the main dj on the top. I spent most of my time at the bottom dance floor because the music was soooo loud on the top floor. Both of the dance floors are pretty small too. I feel that the space is mainly catered to the people who get bottle service, which is not many because if you get bottle service downstairs you would have to stay there. They also do not give you glow sticks that usual night clubs do in Vegas. \nI guess I can't complain because I got in for free because I was with a bunch of girls and we had a promoter. But one thing about that was we had to wait in line for a hour just to get in, because they said we had to be there by a certain time, but they just made us wait. \nOne thing that annoyed me was that there was NOOOOOOO place to sit, unless you got bottle service. Which was ridiculous because not everybody gets bottle service when you go clubbing and for you to not let customers sit down because they didn't have bottle service is annoying and it really did not make me want to go there again. Every time someone was sitting on a ledge of something, security would come over and tell the person to get down. Even in the lounge area there were no seats. There were just tables where you would stand with your drinks. \nThere is also no water fountain where you can get free water. You have to buy small SMALLLLL Fiji water bottles for $9 and hope that will last you the whole night.\nA lot of my friends have hyped up this place up for me but currently this place has only disappointed me."

This is a beerhouse, you'd think they would know how to pour a beer. On top if that the beer wasn't even cold, just slightly lower than room temp. The pretzels I got were about on par with those frozen soft pretzels you can buy at the grocery store. I paid $10 for the pretzels and $5 for the half liter.

    "text": "It is my first sushi venture in Las Vegas area, for a good reason. I am very skeptical of sushi restaurants that are not located within 50 miles off the coast. Sure stuff can be flown everywhere, but restaurants along the coast have a distinct advantage of real fish markets within close proximity. That and Vegas's demand for the ultimate mainstream and average-American friendly thing doesn't quite mean good sushi in my mind. Where dragon rolls are the mark of quality, for me it is quite the opposite.\nHowever, this place was recommended by a worker at my favorite ramen place, so it had to be tried. Tucked away in Henderson in a seemingly empty corner of some retirement community, this is a nice simple modern place with plenty of counter space and an open robata grill to the side. Menu has nice simple Japanese cuisine as well as the dreaded dragon roll that everyone looks for. \nWe sat at the counter with Jun-san, the head sushi chef. He was very friendly and was happy to see that I was a passionate sushi enthusiast, gave us uni from a hidden fridge as well as some domestic kobe beef slightly torched. All the fish came from different sources, such as tai from Japan and chu-toro from Spain, which tells me he puts good thought behind fish purchasing. \nSome great aspects of the kitchen is that they hand-make their own tofu as well as udon. Did not have room for udon but I did try their agedashi which was done very well with light but richly flavored dashi broth. Tofu was soft with a great texture. From the robata we asked for chicken meatball (tenuku?) which was really a hotdog shaped chopped mixture of chicken and herbs, grilled and smothered in sauce, and my favorite, a fresh egg underneath it on the plate that allows the runny yolk goodness smother itself all over the meat (they ask you if you want it when you order, in case you're squeamish, but ahh I love runny eggs). \nThe fish wasn't the freshest but I was told that Sunday is not the best day of the week for him. Apparently Thursday is the day to go. But the uni was nice and sweet, chu-toro nice and firm, and Jun-san treats the ikura himself.\nI was told that this is the best sushi in Vegas area, and I'm ready to believe it. I am no fan of Nobu and this is a great place to be away from all the blinking lights. Overall it was a very pleasant find and I was glad to dine there."

The staff is really friendly. The bouncers aren't cocky cave men..you know like at most clubs \"Grunt.. move along! GRUNT GRUNT.\" The staff smiles and dances and looks like they are having fun. Bottle service here is much cheaper than most places in Vegas so this is a good place to go for that. I think as soon as summer hits the day club/pool will be a great place to hang out.

The fact that the jar was hermetically sealed with clear tape (lest any hooligan snag a matchbook or two) should have been a heads up. \nA truly disproportionate number of booths were full of crafty Michael's castoffs, including but not limited to cheap beading supplies and down-home faux-aged hand painted signs bearing cheesy phrases. Maybe this just reflects the location, as Chandler is a quasi-suburban post-apocalyptic wasteland. Last I checked, Chandler boasts both Michael's AND Hobby Lobby, so one would think the market is saturated.\nAlas, perhaps I am spoiled by the richness of antique/junk store shopping \"in the city\", but I really fail to see how this qualifies as an antique store.

I am like only the only person in the world that has JUST RECENTLY (like in the past 3 weeks!) tried sushi. And I loved it! Nothing too crazy though. This was the \"craziest\" I have tried. And its not even crazy! But I have never seen this on another menu and it was VERY good! The wagyu beef was insane!\nI've had the Macadamia nut crushed mahi mahi a many times at Roy's and its my favorite thing. Its a VERY generous piece of mahi mahi with asparagus and a few potatoes. Yum! I know i'm not going into great detail, but I'm sure its gotta be one of the most popular items on the menu. \nNow, if you leave Roy's without trying the Melting Hot Chocolate Soufflé, you need to be slapped. I'm not kidding. This is my favorite part of the dinner, even though everything else is fabulous. You need to tell your server (they usually ask when you are placing your order) that you will want the chocolate soufflé. The soufflé has this melting chocolate part in the middle, that when it comes to the table, you need to break it open and have it ooze over the vanilla bean ice cream and the raspberry sauce. All of these flavors do a beautiful dance on your tongue and you will be smiling the entire time you are eating it.\nMy parents used to sit at the bar, so they could watch the chefs making the dinners, sushi and soufflé and they always said it was the best part of their dinner.\nThe dinner ran us about $150, including two glasses of wine, but it was well worth the price for this incredible dinner.\nTotal side note: My cousin was a manager at an Outback in Hawaii and Roy's was the only other restaurant on the island. Roy was always there and he said how nice and down to earth guy Roy was. Knowing that, makes me want to eat there even more!\nWhen they seat you, they ask if you are celebrating a special event. And here's why: when it's someone's birthday (I think there were 3 there last night!) they bring out a dessert and take the table's photo. Before you leave, then bring it out in Roy's frame for you to take home. Pretty cool!\nGreat food & great fusion! Nom nom nom!!!"

If you like a lot of hops, though, you'd love that beer!\nI love that it's more traditional right down to the beer hall you sit in, and the staff is well-trained in German brew methods. I didn't get to go on a tour as there was a race in the morning followed by World Cup viewing in the afternoon, but I'd love to go behind the scenes and watch the beer brewing in action.

Besides the wonderful food (try the hanger steak!), the service is top notch! Even though it's in the middle of a casino and can get crowded, the staff is what one would expect when eating at such a famous chef's restaurant. The waitress knew the menu, made wonderful recommendations, and catered to our every need. We started off with the Butternut Squash soup with herb butter (rich!), after I ordered the Traditional Shepard's Pie, made with beef and lamb. It's wonderful topping of whipped mashed potatoes browned to perfection is to die for! My husband ordered the hanger steak, and he offered me a few bites. So tender! Finally, we devoured the sticky, toffee pudding! I can't say enough about our waitress, or the table attendant. So friendly and always asking if we needed anything, and when dinner was served, she came straight by to make sure we were happy! Awesome job!! I nearly nicked Ramsay a star for a lady walking around taking souvenir pictures. She had a rattling loud gab fest at the table next to us in a restaurant that has to modify noise levels anyways. She stayed too long chatting it up at this table. I don't think we need souvenir photographers in a world with Iphones. There was also a very large pool of water in the hallway in the kitchen area that I could see from the restrooms, and it was alarming they'd allow that to be tracked around. My paper menu was soiled as well. Other than that, we'll be back!"

Even though they control the air and heat, it is based on weather trends and not a fixed date.\nThe staff is nice enough, I've never had to deal with them for any issues; I pick up packages and ask random questions when needed and they are professional and helpful. The maintenance guys are really nice and always checking up on me if they see me walking around the property. My A/C went out once in the summer and they were there in an hour or so. Fixed it up quick. And they're really nice when I call about my garbage disposal even though they've shown me where the switch is a few times haha.\nRent is reasonable, staff is nice and helpful, grounds are decent.

I really can't expound on why I found it disgusting. All I remember as I tasted the broth and noodles was a flashback of Warner Bros. cartoons where a character (was it Bugs Bunny?) was shoveling paper money into a burning fireplace. Total waste of money. Mom didn't like the soup, as well. \nA coworker of mine and I met here for happy hour and tried many apps, which I do admit were nicely priced. The low prices aren't enough to get me to return, however. The one plate I remember liking, so much so that I ordered it twice (we were very hungry) was made of tofu. I even wrote it down and asked for it at my favorite sushi resto, but they didn't know what it could be, much less replicate it.

The owners seemed to know most of the customers. Typical of many Asian restaurants, Asians get chopsticks and the rest of us have to ask for them. I think I may have missed out on the really good stuff as I watched plates go by, we ordered off of the Americanized menu rather than the more extensive Chinese menu. We both liked our food although I expected a little more kick from my Kung Pao chicken. The portions were large enough we each took enough home for a lunch.\nOverall I think it is a good value and certainly worth going back to again if I was in the area."

    "text": "I am very sad to update my review to 1 star. It is a good family friendly gym. But there are a few things we do not like:\n1. We had some family visiting from California and wanted to see the gym. They have heard raving reviews from us prior to coming out. After driving all the way down there, we were refused entry at the door even though we had plenty guest passes. The rude lady at the front desk told us that guests cannot work out after 9pm, I explained that even though i was never told this rule, we dont need to work out, I just want to show the gym. She rolled her eyes and said she will have someone following us to make sure we don't work out and leave a note on my file (whatever that means). What was that kind of service? We took guests to show off the gym, and I was extremely disappointed at the service. So from now on, I will definitely stop raving about this place, just in case they decide to embarrass themselves again. \n2. In general, I think there are way too much advertisement in the gym-locker area, common area, even in paid group training classes. We understand that members of the gym is an extremely good demographic to advertise to, but this gym is just too much. I pay $8 to Netflix to not watch ads on tv, I certainly expected better when the membership is about $220 for my husband and I. If you have been to the gym, you have seen the big Toyota posters, and the golf course posters etc., those are fine. Even the ads in the locker rooms are tolerable. There were some toyota sponsored zumba jam, good to know gym classes can get corporate sponsorship. But I took a group training class, which was about $180 extra a month, they were also pumping ads into those classes! There was a nutrition consultant that supposed to be talking to us about healthy eating, but instead, they focused a lot more on what protein powder to buy at the downstairs cafe (as well as telling us to mention their names when u make ur purchase, since they get credit for the sale). Can you guys make your up sales any more obvious and irritating?\n3. Hot yoga is more like uncomfortably warm dry yoga. More humidity in the room please, a little hotter please. Those were some seriously ghetto dry warm wind. \nBottom line is, it is a nice and yet really irritating gym. We hope a worthy competitor will come to the area.

I have a massage place i am very satisfied with, but Massage Envy was running a pretty decent Valentine's Day special. There were two of us, and both of us said ... The massage therapist was nice, but the massages were mediocre. Why ask where to focus if you're just going to brush over the areas? Also, the hour massage includes 10 minutes for changing, so don't expect a full hour. Maybe I've become spoiled by another place, but I was disappointed with the comfort of the beds (sheets not soft at all, no arm rests, and no heated beds!). I was cold the entire hour and each time new lotion was applied, it was freezing and I got goose bumps all over again. Unless you are a member, expect to pay $78 plus a tip for an hour massage. For $20 less, I'll stick with a much cozier and more effective massage place. Thanks anyway. Two stars are given because compared to other Massage Envy locations, the rooms were quiet. For once, I couldn't hear people walking, talking, and doors closing the whole hour."

The kind of horrible where all you can really focus on is getting out because you KNOW it's just so bad that there is nothing they can do to rectify it if you were to complain. It was that bad. Someone else on here commented that the chef should cook for a school cafeteria, and I think that was being too kind and generous!\nWe ordered a few appetizers and split an entree. All three apps came with the same disgusting sauce which was obviously a bizarre mixture of ketchup and duck sauce. Totally gross. They served this same sauce with the egg rolls, tempura vegetables (so terrible) and the tempura tofu, which on the menu said came with peanut sauce. Things were so bad that at one point we joked that maybe we were on candid camera, being pranked or something. \nThe entree was awful too, veggies were overcooked and soggy and even the darned white rice was overcooked and pasty. Unbelievable.\nI thought at least I wasn't paying full price because i was using a restaurant.com certificate, but this horrific lunch still cost us $25 after taking $10 off!! What they don't put in the fine print is that you cannot order off the lunch menu for your certificate, even though it says can only be used at lunch, you have to order off their regular more expensive dinner menu. Great. So then they also work in an 18% gratuity charge onto your total before computing the tax. So they include the tip in the taxable amount???? Crimity! Yes, they did.\nTake my word for it, my husband and I have been to many, many Thai restaurants and this takes the prize for the absolute worst one ever. \nAnywhere else would be better. Our fave still remains Yupha's or Wild Thaiger.\nWe should have run the other direction when we arrived at 1pm to a totally empty place.

Decent sides, cheap drinks, decent service, but extremely tiny and easily packed - especially on Friday nights.\nDetailed review: the fish fry fanatics crew selected Toby's Supper Club as the target for our taste buds this week. We were \"warned\" by a co-worker that it was a \"local/townie\" type place, but it didn't deter us. We ventured out to Toby's, found a parking spot, and muscled our way into the place.\nI say \"muscled\" because the place was PACKED. We arrived at around 7:30pm that evening; we didn't get seated at a table until nearly 10:00pm... It was ridiculously full. And hot. Too many people and not enough A/C, for sure!\nDespite the packed-to-the-gills nature, we were quickly served by the bartenders. Talk about \"machines\" - the two folks that were tending the bar were going non-stop, multi-tasking, and never missing a beat. May not have been the friendliest service, but they were literally giving change while mixing a drink and taking at least 2 additional orders... all at once. Free pretzels were a nice touch as well.\nOh, and did I mention the drinks were cheap?! Whiskey Old Fashioned Sour: $3. Beers - dunno, but we drank for 3 hours on $30. That's good by my book.\nThe ordering process is interesting... you'll be sitting/standing at the bar, and out of nowhere will appear a waitress. She'll take your order and will then grab you when your food and table are both ready. We ordered: Baby Pike, Cod, and Lake Perch with a side of cheesy hashbrowns.\nAs mentioned, the wait was incredibly long - at least 2.5 hours. But it was worth it. Our table became available, we were seated, and we enjoyed a pre-dinner salad (nothing fancy, but fresh and tasty), and the customary carrots/celery/radish/green onion bowl of veggies.\nThe fish arrived, and wow. Wow - that's about all I can say. So wonderful. Lightly breaded, fried to perfection, and not a single hint of grease. Served piping hot, to boot. What we all liked about the fish was the fact that the fish was actually the star - the breading wasn't overdone and it didn't steal any of the thunder from the fish. \nThe hashbrowns were huge and perfectly cooked - dark/crispy brown crust with a perfectly melted cheese blend on top. Just a hint of grease, but we're picking nits here...\nThe bill arrived - $44 for the three of us, including another round of drinks. Our server, Rhonda, was absolutely stellar as well - she took fantastic care of us, and it turns out that her son and his girlfriend were the bartenders.\nSummary: Toby's Supper Club = WIN\nFood: 4.5 - 4.75 stars\nService: 4.5 stars\nValue: 4.5 stars\nAtmosphere: 4.5 stars (classic supper club: paneling, dark wood)\nMisc: Dinged slightly for the long wait and sauna-like heat\nSummary: It's worth the wait to get fish here on Friday nights. Just dress comfortably, bring some cash for the bar, and be prepared to wait."

It's a short drive or a moderate walk from the light rail (a must when my flask joins me for a movie). Overall, the place is always clean, the bathrooms may have water splashed on the counter but I expect that. Although it doesn't happen too often, we have had situations where parents bring their children into movies that are decidedly adult-themed and those children ask questions throughout the movie. However, I'm getting pretty good at zoning nuisances out. \nI may not have enjoyed every movie I've seen here, but the theater is big, clean, very good sound and picture quality, and they serve hot food. What more could I ask for?"

Welling up noticeably, they embraced me with a level of compassion that impressed me immensely. After spending a full hour (and a little more) with my masseuse (Mary), I was in awe of how professional and nice she was making sure my requests of my hurt back was served even though we went over an hour... then managed to compose herself in order to afford the next patient the attention they deserved. I knew from that moment on that I will be coming back to this place on a regular basis. Not only are the people great, but the noise and background music was just perfect. Thank you, SpaMassage for your desire to develop such amazing customer relations while effectively doing your work. -Jamie"

It is now my turn to pull up to the window to get my food. The lady hands me a bag without any expression at all and says \"here you go\". I took my bag and then got on the freeway. A mile down the road, I open the bag. No dipping sauce for my McNuggets and no fucking napkins! I HATE THAT SHIT! Lazy ass workers who don't do their job. I was pissed! The food itself even tasted a bit off. The burger was luke warm and the McNuggets were rubbery and seemed like they had been sitting out awhile.\nFor damn sure I will NEVER come back to this McDonalds!

You can get a takeaway cone or tub, but I challenge you to step inside, see the home-made confectionery counter full of sweets, cakes and handmade chocolates and truffles, and still have the self-restraint to order your take-away and walk out.\nInstead, you'll probably end up spotting the menu, and before you know it you'll be ordering a cappuccino and slab of home-made cake. Yes, they do savoury stuff like sandwiches, home-made pizzas, soups and lasagnes in all their cafés, but why bother with sensible food when you're surrounded by all that sugary goodness?!\nIt's true, the Morningside branch isn't quite as big as the original in Musselburgh and so doesn't stock quite as big a selection to choose from, but I guarantee you won't leave feeling hungry."

Their location is convenient to SSW foot traffic and the combination of seemly tasty (though pricey) offerings displayed on the menus mounted outdoors along with the \"OMG - something new and modern here in the 'Burgh!\" factor was the initial draw of our small party.\nOnce inside we were hustled through a mosh pit style crowd surrounding the bar (I guess we're all desperate for something new in Pittsburgh) to a tiny bar table as the only available seating. After our first round of drinks we were advised the actual wait for a table in the dining area would be considerably longer than initially expected. Despite our cramped seating and jostling of the fuddled crowd we ordered another round and forged ahead dining were we sat. Between the ambient chatter of the crowd and loud music we could barely hear ourselves think let alone comfortably speak with one another . My sisters new fiance (eager to make a good impression on his future mother-in-law), made it clear to the waitress upfront that he would be taking care of our bill for the evening, but in true Rodney 'No Respect' Dangerfield style was consistently ignored throughout the evening, we were served incorrect drinks several times, the appetizers ordered were never brought out (yet were included on the bill), his dinner order was presented incorrectly twice... I could go on.\nOn some level it was comical how many things were going wrong and all we could do was laugh - as the saying goes 'doody happens'. Admittedly, the wait staff was pleasant and appropriately apologetic. The restaurant was beautiful inside (though not particularly unique) with lots of warm wood, white linens, soft lighting, and golden accents. The mark up on a glass of wine was ridiculous (you could buy a bottle for what they charge you for a glass in some cases), but the food was good.\nI'll give them the benefit of the doubt on the service - perhaps they were just getting off to a rough start. I'm sure we'd have had a different experience on the dining side of the restaurant had we waited for a table or made reservations, but I haven't felt inclined to return. Our group consensus was that the price paid in money and aggravation wasn't worth that two hours of our lives."

For me, it fills a void that was left when Chen's Bistro buffet closed a few months ago in the same general vicinity. Despite the uninspiring restaurant name, the interior of China Buffet is much nicer than most Chinese buffets. Most amazing are the entrance with its huge copper doors (which could rival PF Chang's entrances) and host stand area with the oval blue sky and twinkling lights on the ceiling. \nThere are about 10-12 bars of hot and cold foods, plus a Mongolian BBQ area where a chef will cook up your selected meats, veggies, etc. fresh for you, a sushi bar, and a dessert bar with pastries and ice cream. The food is all good, but nothing really stands out as truly exceptional. For true sushi eaters, the sushi is just \"meh.\" It's all very filling, though. There are a lot of foods here for kids and other picky eaters, too. The prices are very reasonable -- $8 for lunch and about $10 for dinner. \nThe buffet area and dining room are all very clean, although the dining room could use a few more separating walls for ambiance. The decor is all really nice, though, and you can tell that they put a lot of money into the restaurant. \nWe'll definitely be going back occasionally on those really hungry lunch days."

The reason why I've never had anyone do my makeup \"right\" (right=makeup actually looks flattering on my face) is probably because I'm Asian. On my wedding day, I decided at last minute to try to get my makeup done. I emphasized that it needed to be with someone who was experienced in working with Asian eyes haha. I figured that in the worst case scenario, if the makeup was really bad, I could just wipe it off and quickly re-do it myself. \nKelly Cardenas Salon hooked me up with Inglot just a few hours before my wedding while I was getting my hair done. Not accounting for makeup time, one of my bridesmaids and I had to run (yes, literally run) through Caesar's after being dropped off from my hair appointment. Man, this place was hard to find. We had to ask 4 people.\nThe sweatiness and shortness of breath was worth it when we got there though. We told them that we were in a hurry, and Kelsey got to work right away. She asked what I was looking for, and even though I was a bit vague, she ended up doing a wonderful job. All I really said was that I wanted my bridal makeup to look pretty natural but I wanted my eyes to be just a little more dramatic since it was an evening wedding. She was so nice and accommodating- even when I wanted my eyeliner re-done and when we had to go through multiple lipsticks and glosses to find the perfect lip color. \nI absolutely loved how my makeup turned out for my wedding day. It stayed on and looked perfect all night long. Oh, and the extra plus: My full face of makeup only came out to be $40!\nI also called Inglot today to purchase the products that she used on me. Their products are so affordable! She's currently going the extra mile to try out some eye shadows to make sure that I'm ordering the same colors that she used on me. Thanks so much, Kelsey! I could not ask for better customer service- a perfect experience!"

Beer was good and nice and cold, not flat or warm. Generous amount of peppers and onions on the sandwich. Was hot fresh and tasty. Prime rib was cut nice with little fat but still juicy and tender. Only criticism would be that the bread got a little soggy. Ended up eating second half with fork and left bread. I would recommend Henry's to anyone that is looking for good food at a good price.

I adore the savory/sweet combo of fried leeks, grapes and gorgonzola. The artichoke spread is another favorite of mine.\n$5 glasses of wine before 5pm are a great excuse to day drink. Start off with the Ravenna reisling before moving on to some of the heartier reds. If the Imprint pinot noir is available, go for it!

We waited FOREVER for our food (which was served by other people? maybe it just works that way there?), then waited another forever for our check.

Their Matar Paneer is also fantastic, and their vegetable dishes (those that have potatoes, cauliflower, etc.) are also very good. The Naan is not bad either when you get it fresh because it's fluffy and has some oil on it for flavor, but if it's not fresh, I'd definitely pass on it because it gets all dry.

But you should still ask them to put fries and hot sauce on your wrap, it's a nice touch. Thank you My T for the tip brosky!\nThis place has really bad reviews. Granted service is not like you're going to get at Robouchon, but cmon, it's not that bad. I really like the fatoush, it's more authentic than most places in Summerlin. The chicken shawarma was great. So juicy, not dry at all, I'm surprised at what everyone else is saying.\nI will come back! Someone mentioned waiting 15 minutes for their food? Is that really that bad? Cmonnnnnnnnn"

Service was very friendly but the product was lackluster.\nOpted for their signature sando, the Streetcar Poboy, served with a side of coleslaw and Cajun chips. The bread that Emily R praises as craveworthy did not even taste fresh, which really brought down my impression of the overall sandwich. Topped with shrimp, oysters, and catfish, it was a hearty portion and didn't have anything wrong with it, but it didn't live up to the praise. I felt that Gritz Cafe better executed a poboy and it's not even their main menu item.\nCajun chips served alongside my sandwich were bland, underseasoned, and seemed borderline stale. Service will keep this place on my radar to try their piroque and alligator on another visit, but I'm hoping I just caught them on an off night."

I had White Chocolate Raspberry and Pumpkin Cheesecake. Both of the flavors were amazing! My favorite was the White Chocolate Raspberry, but the cheesecake flavor in the Pumpkin Cheesecake was really good. My girlfriend had the Banana Cream Pie, which was also great. There is absolutely nothing bad to say about any of the food here. Everything tastes fresh and delicious, as expected from a place whose products come from their own, local farm!\nThe service was also impeccable. The people behind the counter are very friendly! My girlfriend and I hadn't been before and didn't know what we wanted, but we didn't want to be the annoying people who just keep sampling everything, but they told us to just keep sampling. They didn't seem bothered by the possibility of us trying every flavor, they actually encouraged it before we decided!\nAnyways, this place is great. If it was closer to where I lived, it would definitely be my go-to place for some awesome ice cream!"

What you are going to find is traditional Napolitano pizza, a very thin, super-heated crust, a thin spread of San Marzano tomatoes (chunky, not like American style pizza sauce) and the best mozzarella you've probably ever tasted. Hands down fantastic, I can't wait to go back. On a side note, the desserts kind of suck. They tasted old, over-chilled and dried out."

We were both eager to try some South West BBQ. The restaurant is nicely decorated and show cases the many BBQ awards, and trophies, won at different BBQ competitions. I was surprised to see that the restaurant was not very busy. We both had a combo platter. I had it with brisket and pulled pork and my wife had the pulled pork and ribs. For sides I had the cole slaw and potato salad. My wife had the cole slaw and baked beans. Our orders came out in a timely manner and were served by one if the owners. She was very nice and told us about how she, and her husband, got into BBQ. She also told us about some of the awards they had won. Our pulled pork was tender and flavorful. It was lightly coated with their sweet BBQ sauce. The star of the show, for me, was the brisket. It was so tender, flavorful and juicy. My wife's ribs were fall off the bone good. The part that I wasn't crazy about were the sides. My cole slaw was swimming in mayonnaise liquid and my potato salad was a bit bland to me. My wife's beans were, well, beans, and ok. My sides just didn't wow me, they were just there. How about some home made corn bread stuffing or dirty rice? Something different instead of the standard cole slaw and potato salad would have been better. Over all, very good BBQ. Next time, I would go for a brisket sandwich with a side of fries and skip the sides."

That's right this place was a solid OK. I can't believe the yelp team couldn't identify average food! The salad was something you buy at the grocery store in a bag. As for the meatballs, it tasted as though they had been made 3 days ago and simply heated. They tasted old and manufactured like something you would eat at a potluck for retired people. The best part of the dinner was the wine. Bottom line, if you want a place that isn't going to break the bank and you are craving Fazoli's, go to Nora's on W. Flamingo. If you are looking for a good Italian meal on the west side . . . try Mastrioni's."

    "text": "Our meals were OK and service started out well and then went downhill. I should have paid more attention to the reviews of my two friends on Yelp. Live and learn.\nWe were here about 4:15 yesterday afternoon and there were very few people there. We were seated immediately and brought menus and drinks. The chips and salsas were brought and our server explained that the warm salsa was spicy and the cold salsa was not spicy. The chips and spicy salsa were good. The chips are very thin and I found I broke several in half dipping them in the salsa.\nFor our dinners, I ordered the Tacos al Pastor. Here's the description from their menu: Spicy pork with pineapple, pico de gallo and cilantro. My wife ordered the Tampico which is described as: Grilled chicken breast topped with sautéed artichoke hearts, mushrooms, spinach, red bell peppers with sour cream-poblano sauce and monterey jack cheese.\nMy tacos were just OK. The biggest problem with them was there was only one taco. When I get tacos like this at genuine Mexican places, they're always doubled so there's some body to help hold the filling. With my tacos and the single shell, the pico was wet enough that it softened the taco and made it almost impossible to pick up to eat. I did eat the first one that way but I was awash in juice. The pork was OK, but the spice was a heavy coating on the pork. It was spicy but other than that, there wasn't a whole lot to recommend the tacos. I also thought of the al pastors I've gotten from street vendors on East Charleston for a fraction of the cost I paid. Stupid me! With my tacos came rice and black beans. My wife liked her chicken and it was as described. It's the kind of dish you might get at any Tex/Mex kind of restaurant.\nDessert was the star of the night. I got the très leches cake and she got the Mexican brownie. My cake was excellent. Her brownie came with a bit of table side ta da!\nThe brownie was placed on a very hot cast iron dish safely in a recessed wooden holder. Then the vanilla ice cream was put on top of the brownie. LAst, the sauce was poured over the ice cream and when the sauce hit the hot dish, it bubbled and made a kind of extra buttery syrup that added to the flavor of the brownie and ice cream. \nNow to service: Up until the time we got our meals, everything was going along fine. Then our server disappeared. She came back once and asked about the food and then was gone again. 10 minutes after we finished our dishes, she was nowhere to be found. The host looked at us several times and it seemed as though he was going to get her at one point but that was not the case. Finally she showed and we asked about a box and asked about dessert. She said she'd get the dessert tray and be back.\nAgain she was just gone. About 5 minutes later, another server stopped and asked if we wanted a box. We told him we'd already asked for one and then he brought his tray down to show us the desserts. We made our choice with him. A few minutes later, our server and this second person arrived with the desserts. She stood by as he did the table ta da for the brownie. Then she left again. About 6 minutes later, she came back with the check and just put it down. \nWhen I finished dessert and we had some time to relax and talk, I got my credit card out and put it in the holder and within 10 seconds, she was there to pick it up. Wow, Speedy Gonzales then but not at the needed times. \nI really like Tivoli Village and there are some other restaurants there that I have yet to try. But, Cantina Laredo won't be one of them. We have so many small places along East Charleston that there's no reason to ever go here again."

The grilled steak/ mango salad was spicy and full of nuts, cheeses and veggies. Great for large groups, singles, couples. Clean and open, casual or dressy fine here. All types and characters.

You can borrow a book from the bookshelf, listen to good music when they have open mic night or just go in with an iPhone like I did and chill.

    "text": "We went here Friday night and had fairly high expectations for Paris 66. I was looking forward to a decent crepe! We were immediately greeted by one of the owners in the cramped entry. She advised that our wait would be approximately 30 minutes, although she mentioned that she hadn't been in the back for awhile and didn't know what was going on back there. She did take our phone number and said she would called us. Great! We wandered around nearby businesses. Fine. We went back 30 minutes later, being very optimistic. When we arrived, we saw that our position on their notepad, (yes, they have a very sophisticated way of tracking their wait list), had not changed. So, either no one had come in since we were last there, or they had been seating customers as they came in. We were told by a different host that our wait would be just 30 minutes. When we explained that we were told that 30 minutes ago, she became flustered and said we would be seated as soon as possible. So, this time, we decided to wait in the cramped entry next to the glass display case looking at yummy food. \nNow let me say, they have made great use of the space in these very confined quarters. The kitchen is right inside the front door, (you can see crepes being made outside thru the front window), the chef and cooks are bursting with energy, working at a hectic pace to prepare the orders. They are warm and friendly and greet all the customer. A cash register is also located here, along with the dessert case. Tables are small and packed close together. Walls have a weathered finish, the lighting thru out is ambient, the fixtures are beautiful, all the walls are covered with old fashioned posters, post cards are under glass on the tables. Very nice. The exterior and interior finishes are very, very nice. \nWe were offered a dining room table or a table on the patio. We happily took the patio, the fresh air was very nice after waiting by the kitchen. Not a lot to look at outside, but it's very relaxing there. We got a nice table in the corner next to large pot of flowers. \nService was sub par. Our server waffled between her fake accent and Yinzer girl. Okay. We were not offered a beverage. She wasn't well rehearsed on the menu, except to say \"we are out of that\" twice. We also noticed that she struggled to open the wine of customers that BYOB'ed. Another thing that seemed odd was, mid way thru our dinner, one of the owners came busting out the back door with a table. She placed it in the middle of the patio, a server came out with a high chair, they moved it around a couple times and then customers came outside packing their own meals and then stood around and then decided to find their own chairs. Kinda strange. \nI ordered La St Germain, a buckwheat crepe with ham & swiss served with a small side salad. I thought it was a bit tough and dry and couldn't eat more than 1/2 of it. Also, it was contained very little ham or swiss, however the salad was nice. BJ had Paris-Brest, a salad served with scallops, shrimp, mussels and pesto. The scallops, (only 2) were well prepared, the shrimp (4) were tiny but well seasoned and the mussels (4) were over cooked and very tough. It was supposed to be served with bread, but none found it's way to our table. BJ also had the carrot & vanilla soup, which was nice. \nI so wanted a crepe for dessert, but after the savory crepe, I was afraid to try one of the sweets. Instead, we shared an apple tart. It was perfect, served with a bit of creme anglaise. The crust was very flaky, the apples were perfect. Our server gave us spoons to eat the tart, so that was a struggle. \nI'm sure Paris 66 will do well in Pittsburgh and I wish them well. However, I was not at all impressed with our experience."

It had a live jazz singer. I was a little taken aback because it has the ambience of a fine steak restaurant like a Donovans as opposed to a nice Italian restaurant. It was a nice change of scenery from your usual west coast trendy yet casual Phoenix restaurant ambience. \nThe service was also excellent. Our waiter was hyper animated which was a little annoying yet appreciated because he was attentive. Overall the service was nearly perfect. All the waiters had manners and were old school in their mannerism. Again, this was a welcome change from the trendy young stud or hot girl who act like they are too cool to be serving tables. \nIn regards to the food....DISAPPOINTING. I was really shocked. I really wanted to like this place but the food had no flavor. There is nothing about the food that would make one want to go back. The eggplant parmegan was sloppy and watery egglant that tasted like boiled egglant. The tortalleni ruffino was served in an alfredo sauce that tasted like potato soup poured onto pasta. It was so thick and tasteless. The tortelini had no flavor and it's filling was bland. \nThe restaurant does some things to provide one with a homely feel. They serve garlic bread toasts as free appetizers and constantly refresh it. The jazz music in the background was also a nice touch. Stil the atmosphere was a bit claustrophobic for me."

( It's no surprise that at this point I (Heart) Shelly). \nAbout 30 minutes later Shelly gave me a call to inform me that she had left and was on her way. I met her outside of the lobby, got my pie, exchanged pleasantries and retreated to my room to enjoy the delicious smells that were coming out on the box \nI ordered Kind \"O\" Hearts, a choose your own 6 topping monster of a pizza. Hearty enough, even with my large appetite to give me three meals worth of food. You wouldn't know it (or maybe you do I shouldn't assume) but Austin has it's fair share of great pizza. Whether you get Home Slice, East Side Pies, or South Side Flying Pizza they're all tops in my book and this pizza was right up there with them.\nYou can tell that dough is home made, and the toppings are plentiful and fresh. I'm so glad that (A Thai place that is in the same area that I'm not sure if I can say their name) didn't pick up the phone each of the three times i tried to call them or i would have missed out on this wonderful experience. And again, Thank You Shelly"

This is reasonably priced fare for a slightly more sophisticated palate. Sabor provides you with culinary masterpieces that create a whole new experience for your taste buds. I have been five times in two months and have thoroughly enjoyed each entree I've tried. While I have my favorites (the Chicken Poblano has an amazing flavor that you simply cannot forget) my wife prefers the Blackened Arrachera. The food at Sabor creates more of a dining experience, one that you will cherish, rather than just satisfying your appetite. The chef, Scott, definitely knows what he is doing and the waiters and other staff are both efficient and friendly. Do yourself a favor, this is a dining experience that you will usually have to travel to a five star resort restaurant and it's tucked away in a quiet corner of Henderson."

It's somewhat challenging, but only takes about 15 minutes to reach the summit.\nThe parking lot south of Greenway on 16th St is relatively small, but no worries about finding a spot to park your car. The mountain isn't used and abused like it's cousins to the southwest(Camelback, Squaw Peak). So not only do you not have to fight for a parking spot, you don't have to worry about people getting in your path on the way up or down. Quite peaceful if you ask me! I only hope that it stays this way as the Phoenx metro area gets larger and more spread out."

I assume that all mall restaurants are either a franchise of some awful chain or some restaurant corporation's lowest common denominator cuisine. Well, I couldn't be more wrong about Christopher's located in the Biltmore Fashion Park Mall. Everything I had was great: lobster bisque, duck confit salad, lobster pot pie, and a vanilla soufflé for dessert. The prices are most reasonable, and there's even a happy hour from 3-6 pm. Best of all, everything I had was real food, that is, food made from scratch (nothing frozen, out of a jar, can, or plastic bag) from fresh ingredients. Also, the service was friendly, attentive, and very professional. I can't wait to go back!"

This guy was rude from the beginning. it took him some time to come to our table. finally we ordered but it took more than half an hour before I went to ask how much more do we have to wait for the food. he replied rudely \"how long has it been since you ordered \". And at that point I asked him that I would need to contact the owner of the place. apparently the guy in the kitchen was the owner. he couldn't care less either and said it would be at least 10 more minutes if not longer. Made no effort to rectify or solve the issue. After we saw this 'take it or leave it 'attitude, we just left and went some where else. if you are looking for bad service and attitude this is the place to go. With other places next door that offer good food and excellent service, this place will close again! Apparently, this place had another name before. Either a new name or management.

    "text": "Here are the things I've learned flying JetBlue for the past five years.\n1. They are THE ONLY airline with nonstop flights from Las Vegas to Boston (and I mean Logan Airport in Boston. Not TF Green (RI) or Manchester (NH). The only other one is SouthWest that fly into Manchester.\n2. Their point system for their frequent flyer program called TrueBlue used to build up super fast. Now not so much, can't tell if it's because of their new point system or that flying costs more now. Either way they have done away with their expiration of points that use to happen if you didn't fly for a full calendar year.\n3. In the summer your flight will most likely be delayed because of heavy storms in the southeast US since their planes seem to work off of a triangle cycle. For instance, my flight back to Las Vegas from Boston was delayed because the plane was coming up from South Carolina which was experiencing a tropical storm. Also, they seem to rely heavily on their flights coming in on time as I have had flights delayed because the stewards that came in on a different plane were assigned to ours, and that incoming plane was delayed.\n4a. Love the fact that they had LCD screens in every seat with DirecTV and Sirius/XM radio, but the screens are seriously outdated and you can't plug in your media player in to watch movies on the screen (USB or Video in). I've been told by a JetBlue associate newer planes they are getting have USB and power adapters, but not in all seats (that's actually pretty typical, for instance Air Canada doesn't have power plugs at the window seats) along with in-flight wireless internet.\n4b. Because the LCD screens are outdated, the pay movies aren't shown in HD, so you get to spend $5 on watching a movie on a screen with the resolution detail that is less than a hand held device. The pilots seem to have become more stingy in their free movie comps. A late takeoff or small turbulence was enough to get the pilot to turn on free movies. Now it doesn't seem to happen at all :(\n5. If you live in Las Vegas, or any other city on the west coast, your choice for destinations to redeem your JetBlue points are really limited since they concentrate all of their business out of NY and Boston. Want to go to the Caribbean? You're connecting in NY. Want to visit family in Chicago? You're connecting in NY. A vacation in Florida? You have a choice: connect in NY or connect in Boston. In other words: You're going east to go west, and going north to go south. It's a lot of flying and not worth the time or stress.\n6a. They seem to have some partnerships with a few airlines, but usually to fill in service gaps for the other airlines, and mostly out of NY and, to a smaller degree, Boston. I want to fly to San Diego, JetBlue doesn't fly there. American Airlines does, too bad I can't build up JetBlue points by using American Airlines, but I can build up American Airline points on some JetBlue flights. Bottom line is if you travel a lot from LAS to major cities on the west coast then hang on to your SouthWest Rapid Rewards Visa card if you got one.\n6b. This one sided partnership is really frustrating since they brag about their partnerships with so many airlines, especially international ones, but is of little or no use to us in America. Especially if you're not in NY. These partnerships again only seem to serve as service fillers for international customers from other airlines who need to fly from NYC to Buffalo, or Boston to Cape Cop, or another destination that doesn't get that much air traffic.\n7. Love, love, love that JetBlue is in the new Terminal (3) at LAS. Terminal 1 was turning into such a mad house."

I went on the Echo Canyon trail which is supposed to be harder.\nParking is very limited. There will be a lot of people there so you might get lucky but I didn't. There are about 35-40 parking spaces. You can park on an area on 56th that is a few minutes from the main entrance. From parking to the trail is about a mile walk.\nYou will sweat. Now is not the time to try to be prim and proper because by the time you make it back down you will look awful, but in a good way because others there will be able to empathize. You will have to crawl, scoot, and use what ever means necessary to climb especially if you're a novice. Believe me, some of the rocks there got very familiar with me! There is railing and fencing at the beginning but after that it's all nature!\nDress lightly, bring lots of water, proper shoes, and a positive attitude. Climbing up can be just as difficult as climbing down so it's great to stay optimistic. I used my boyfriend as motivation since he was leaping on the rocks like a billy goat!\nDon't rush. If you are in regular health and new to hiking it will take about an hour to make it up. Sure you will see Bodybuilder Bob but don't let that hasten your hike. The rocks can get slippery and if you rush thinking you have superhuman abilities, especially if it's your first time hiking you can seriously hurt yourself. And don't be fooled that it will be easier going down, go down with more precaution than you used going up.\nThe people there are great. They will encourage you and talk to you. So good luck and make sure you take lots of pictures once you make it up the top because this isn't something you want to miss out on for pictures!"

There were 12 of us sitting at a U-shaped table, which was nice since everyone could talk to everyone. Well, we could if we weren't right next to the band, but oh well. \nI think the appeal for this place is definitely the atmosphere. It is almost like a show where they serve food and alcohol, as opposed to a restaurant. There is one older Greek dude with two lazy eyes who kind of MC's the \"event\". You can really only understand every fourth word he says, but at least it is somewhat authentic. The band was good, with a rag-tag group of Greek gentleman. Although the drummer reminded me of Big Pussy from the Sopranos. A belly dancer came out and fell in love with my buddy Peter. He was in love too, I think. You also get to throw ceramic plates onto the dance floor and yell OPA! \nThe food was decent, nothing spectacular. I had a baked Halibut fillet with a lemon bechemel sauce. It came with potatoes and vegetables. The veggies were a little disappointing. They obviously weren't fresh, most likely canned. We did try the calamari, which was good. They have Stella! This made me happy. \nOverall the party had a great time, but I don't think anyone was blown away by the food. The same strange lazy-eyed Greek gentleman shook everyones hand on the way out. That was nice, but I ended up smelling like whatever cologne he had just taken a bath in."

I have only used them for eyebrows, so my review is based on that service specifically. And yes, it does hurt! Oh, the things girls go through....\nI have been going off and on to Eyebrows R Us for several years now. I started going when they only had 1 store in the valley and have stuck with them through the years, on and off. I don't live super close, so I only visit a ERU if I am near one on another errand, otherwise I just wax my eyebrows at my local nail place. I have been to several of their locations and service seems to be the same across the board. So good points for being consistent on eyebrows! They always do a good job and I am always pleased with the look of my brows afterwards. \nThe prices are also pretty good at $10 or you can get prepaid cards for discounted services if you plan on visiting regularly. The cards don't expire, so even if you don't go regularly, but every now and then, the card is still worth it. They also offer very reasonably priced unlimited programs for a month, 6 months, and up to a year. \nThe reason I am giving them a 3 star rating is the customer service portion. No one ever seems to be smiling and or happy whenever I am there. I get everyone has bad days, but every single time and not one person is smiling.....Weird! No one is ever very welcoming or pleasant when you talk to them. They always just tell you to sign in and they usually just point to you when it is your turn. If it is your first time, they also seem a little annoyed during the threading if you don't know how to hold your eyebrow during the session. I don't think I have ever had more than a 2 sentence conversation with anyone at any of their locations. So if you want friendly people, don't come here. If you don't mind, then go for it, because they are good at eyebrows!\nSo there you have it. Decide for yourself and good luck with your eyebrows!"

When I went to pick up the pizzas I commented that both pizzas appeared small and how the box appeared to be too large for the pizzas. 2 employees assured me that both pizzas were 16\". When I arrived home with the pizzas my wife also commented how small they were so we took out a ruler and measured them both at 14\" which is the size of a \"Large\" not the 16\" \"Extra large\" which we ordered and paid for.\nI drove back to Papa Johns on Anthem Village Dr. with the pizzas and asked for the manager. He told me that both pizzas were 16\" and there was NO PROBLEM. I then pulled out my ruler and the manager said well if you want I will remake them for you. The franchise owner is having the employees make smaller than ordered size pizzas and charging the customer for the larger size. They are now also charging $0.10 per packet for cheese & red pepper. Time to find another pizza place in 89052 that does not steal from customers."

I was very excited to learn about his new offering, and waited for my next trip to make that a reality. I came with a large group and opted to try the onion soup, a fillet, and some sides. While none of the food was horrible, none of it was excellent. The steak was decent, but slightly overcooked, the meat quality was just OK, it wasn't as good as craftsteak.\nGreat waiters, good wine selection. The port selection was decent, but not as good as other locations. The Mirage is a bit beat up, and thankfully you didn't have to venture too deep considering it's right at the front door.\nI will stick to craftsteak, but this is a decent choice."

Usually I leave a strip restaurant with an empty wallet and my tummy grumbling like gremlin after midnight, but not in this case. I must have had about 4 cocktails and a couple of other drinks which were OK but didn't blow my mind. There was one drink that was mostly crushed ice. I don't remember the name but I'll remember to stay away from it next time. \nFor starters we had the crab cakes, escargot, and roasted bone marrow, and a leek soup. The stars there were the leek soup and the roasted bone marrow. On a later trip to the Wicked Spoon buffet I found a comparable roasted bone marrow. They were all pretty good. \nI ordered the scallop special. The scallops were perfectly clean and cooked with a pistachio crust. the pistachio crust gave an extra layer of texture and flavor to the scallops, I would definitely have that again. Overall a pretty good experience. I am still surprised that I walked out of there full."

Downstairs is usually reserved for larger groups, tailgates, late nights and football. They have a decent beer list (30 or so) but for a place called draught you'd think they'd have a few more options on tap.\nDecently sized menu - everything from more standard pub pub favorites like burgers, sandwiches, flatbreads, and wings but also a few curveballs such as shrimp rice bowl, duck tacos, and lettuce wraps.\nGood place for lunch, happy hour or football."

I went with a coworker around noon and we were the only ones in the restaurant. Although it's inside O'Aces, it did feel like a separate establishment. The decor was nice and it felt like an actual restaurant, not a sports bar or dive bar. There were three small flat screens spread throughout the walls of the dining room on various sports channels, so that was a plus for me since I'm a huge sports fan.\nThe service was excellent. Our waiter was very nice and friendly. She was attentive to when we needed drink refills and took it upon herself to give us refills before we had to ask. I had the stromboli and my coworker had the chicken fingers. Not the best stromboli I've ever had (that honor goes to Four Kegs), but it was really good. The portion size was good, and came with a side of marinara for dipping. The chef also came out to ask us how the food was. I thought that was a nice touch.\nThe prices were fairly reasonable, but we used Groupon Now vouchers, so it ended up being a great deal. They had no problem with us using two vouchers for one table. Some places limit Groupon usage to one per table, but not here.\nPaparazzi Grill is definitely a place I will return to."

    "text": "It's too bad that I've taken so long in getting around to writing a review of Sensi, so unless you trust my long-term memory, I'd suggest ignoring most of this review and just going with the recommendation to eat here. I mean, even if you only spend one night in Vegas, this is where you should have dinner. And I should know: I went to two restaurants when I was there, and this one was better.\nIn all seriousness, though, Sensi was my first (yes, of two) introduction to the fancy restaurant scene in Vegas. I'd heard a lot about various famous chefs opening new restaurants here, but I figured rather than Nobu Next Door these places would be more like Nobu Up The Block And Around The Corner And Then Take Your Third Left After The Light. In short, I expected mediocre food at exorbitant prices. At Sensi, neither was the case. \nFirst of all, I for the most part do not care about decor. As long as I'm not knocking knees with another diner, I feel fine with a chair at a table. But this place is so cool. It's very modern and sleek but in a warm way, which is to say you don't get the feeling that your very presence might be ruining the otherwise super cool atmosphere. There's a lot of smooth gray rock all over the place, and water falling down it. It's clean and pleasant. \nAnd the food is delicious. We had a tuna three ways to start--raw, raw, raw--and it was unique and very tasty. I say \"unique\" because I have several times ordered tuna only to remember, Oh, right, I've had this a million times before. This one tasted like someone actually put some effort into it. We also had a calamari dish, not deep-fried but the sauteed kind, which is much more interesting to me, which came with this amazing lightly breaded cooked tomato. The combination of flavors was lovely and impressive in that it seemed creative but was not at all overpowering. \nSensi is some kind of fusion between Indian and Japanese and maybe a few other things. Typically the idea of fusion drives me nuts; when I have a PB&J sandwich for dinner with a side of leftover pad thai, I don't go around saying I just made myself a Thai-American fusion meal. But I think they do a pretty good job at Sensi of making everything well enough so that they earn the right to serve different kinds of foods. I guess we started with Japanese? Anyway, for entrees we chose two different kinds of curry, a red shrimp curry and a chicken tikka masala. The latter was sub-standard, by which I mean that it didn't taste as good as chicken tikka masala at my local Indian favorite. But the shrimp was great--and I don't even like shrimp that much! It was high quality (i.e. it actually tasted like something) and it came in this awesome little coconut bowl (real, I think), and the rice was delicious and we got naan bread that was, as good naan bread is, out of this world.\nI don't remember the desserts as being that great, but I'm pretty hard to please when it comes to desserts. If it's too sweet I don't like it, if there's orange flavor I don't like it, if there's chocolate mixed with cherry I don't like it. Probably it's a good idea to skip dessert and just buy some Mrs. Fields cookies on your way back to the slot machines."

I am not typically one to write horrible reviews as every restaurant has an off night or two, however the service and quality of food we experienced was absolutely unexcuseable. \nHere are some tips if you are dining with a party larger than a couple;\n-Absolutely do not order dessert as an appetizer...this will completely throw off the server and he will appear very displeased that someone would possibly think of ordering tiramisu as their meal. Shame on you. \n-Avoid the steamed broccoli (smelled like cigarettes) and gnocchi (also known as marinara soup), \n-Do not even think about ordering a slice of pizza on Friday or Saturday nights (this is NOT ALLOWED)\n-If you do order a pizza...be sure to clarify your toppings several times. If not, your pizza will be sent back through the pizza oven again with any toppings left off the first time (this is clearly your own fault). The result is crust as chewy as an eraser. Delicious. \n-Be sure to arrange your party's ordering and requests around the server's smoke breaks\n-Order as many drinks as you think you will want when you first get there...any refills or additional rounds you will have to order from the bar yourself (see above for smoke break scheduling)\n-Upon conclusion of the meal, the server will stress several times as he is passing out your checks that he did not charge you gratuity EVEN THOUGH you are a very larger party\n-By no means are you allowed to stay past 10:30, the restaurant staff will show their unhappiness with you by stacking every single chair that is not occupied on top of the tables. Oh, and the cooks will also begin busing whatever is left in front of you...whether you are eating it or not. \nEnjoy Villa Francesca!"

The only other show I've seen on the strip was La Reve but I would have to say that I like Mystere much more. I liked the costumes, the music, and the style of dancing as well. \nMy favorite part was the 2 guys doing handstand press ups on each other. At one point, one of them was doing a handstand on the other guys foot that was suspended in the air. My other favorite part was the teeter-totter action. Two guys would trade off launching eachother high in the air...and while in the air, they'd do backflips and twists. I used to be a gymnast and I know how much muscle, skill and control it needs to do this type of stuff.

You will be hoarse after having a meal here just from trying to talk to the person across from you. \nSecond, the parking situation is awful here. You have to park on the street in an area with lots of no parking signs. This means you will have to park pretty far away usually, and if you find parking on a Saturday night, even if it is half a mile away, you are grateful to have found a spot at all.

    "text": "Hands down, the best Chinese food in Las Vegas, without breaking your wallet unlike places like Jasmine in the Bellagio. This place is a ways off the strip, a pretty expensive cab ride. If I recall correctly it was close to 20 bucks from T.I. \nMy family used to have property in LV and whenever we would be in town we would frequent this place a lot. You would expect to that this place would be in Chinatown but its actually off of Spring Mountain and closer to auto-row. And it's next to a Subway so you can't really miss it. \nService here isn't upscale, its not even close to Vegas. It's more HK than anything else. You sit down, get a pot of tea and that's pretty much it until you order. So when the time comes, what do you order?\nFrom my experience, the best things to get there are:\n1. Ginger and Green onion oysters- They lightly fry the oysters first and then wok toss them with ginger, green onions, and their sauce. The oysters come to your table piping hot, steaming and fragrant. One bite and it's almost instant nirvana. Hands down, quite possibly the best oysters in this style that I've ever had. \n2. Dry Beef Chow Fun- Yeah i know it's a common staple everywhere and almost everyone knows what this is and can find it at any Chinese restaurant. But is it ever GOOD? They say that although it may seem simple. this dish takes a master chef who knows what he's doing to make it taste the way it's supposed to taste. By far, this place has the best version I've ever had. It's so aromatic, so flavorful, the balance between the light soy sauce and the marinated beef, the onions and bean sprouts, it's all so perfect. But the best part is literally the time and effort that they take to make this dish. Usually whereever I go, the ho fun noodles come to me either completely brown, smothered by soy sauce, white with a few tinges of brown, or the yin yang effect where one side of the noodles are brown, and the other is white. At this place, you'll find your noodles perfectly golden brown, with a bit of 'crust' on the side. This is where you know they spent that time on it. The extra seconds the chef spent on this dish, tossing it in the wok, results in the edges of the noodles being burnt ever so slightly, thereby giving this dish a characteristic taste you won't find at most places. \n3. Corn sauce Fish- dunno what to call this in English, but basically what it is is batter fried fish filets, smothered in a corn and egg drop sauce. It's so good I can't even describe it. \n4. Garlic and Chilli Eggplant- You can optionally get this with Duck feet, but altogether this plate is awesome. It's tangy, its spicy, its decandent, it's delightful.\nOverall, I must say, coming from San Francisco where the Chinese population by far shadows the population in LV, this place has better Chinese food. I'm serious. It's seriously comparable to Hong Kong style. Maybe they imported their chef. Almost everything on the menu is awesome. Forget those high end places like PF Changs or Jasmine. This is the place to go for affordable, authentic, and REAL Chinese food."

They just renovated so the room i stayed in was nice. There weren't any noise or bug problems, service was accommodating, and the valet acted professional. The downside is the check in line takes forever, I was lucky to check in early before the madness started. Let me put it this way, I saw some tourists in line when i went to gamble, shop, eat, gamble again, drink, and gamble one last time and when I came back those same tourists were still in line! \nNote: When you check out you can avoid the line by checking out on your tv, just follow their easy directions. Also, if you are late packing up you can call and ask for an extra hour to check out for free."

We had a 2 hour wait but you can leave and they'll text you when the table is ready.\n If you have the casino members card, you get $1 off each menu item. So while you're waiting for your table, go get the players card. \nThe restaurant doesn't have tables for groups larger than about 4 so you would have to split up. We had a group of 7 but they sat us in a area about right next to reach other.\nCustomer service was spot on. Very friendly and informative waiters. \nHere was what we ordered:\nShake #4 creme brulee pudding + Oreo shake + Oreo cookie = best shake ever!!!! LOVED IT since I love both of those, this was a perfect combo! The drink isn't super thick and milky surprisingly but more creamy. I couldn't stop drinking it. It actually made me full from eating my burger lol.\nHoney pig bao buns - roasted pork belly, pickled cucumber and radish, cilantro and honey hoisin sauce. It was good but I did wish the roasted pork belly was crunchy. It was soft though. The bun was very moist and soft. Overall, I liked it because of the pickled toppings that went with it. \nFarm burger- duck breast bacon cheddar and fried egg. This was one of the best burger I have had in a long time! They egg yolk was perfectly cooked to how I like it, runny. The duck breast bacon was good but a little too salty but still good. The hamburger buns were very fluffy and compliment the burger meat well. It did not overwhelm the burger. \nMy husband got the Hell's Kitchen burger. It was very spicy but he loved it. The avocado was delicious with the burger. Meat was juicy and the burger was very flavorful. The bun on this burger was the same as the farm burger. Fluffy and went well with the burger.\nMy siblings got the Hog Burger and enjoyed it very much so. Juicy, cooked to perfection of medium rare with the awesome bun. \nWe would all come back here again next time. Totally worth your money!"

I love going there and I frequently crave it. They also give out stamp cards where you buy 10 drinks over time and get one free. I have yet to fill one up completely though because I keep loosing the cards. \nMy favorites include the watermelon slushie and the strawberry banana smoothie. Get a large as well! The price is only 50 cents more for a large in most cases. Your really cheating yourself out if you don't get the actual tapioca balls in your drink, so I definitely suggest adding the boba to your drink."

So about 10 minutes later he walks up and hands us a box of crayons with a store receipt still in his hand because he had just ran to the store to purchase crayons!!! Talk about service!!!\nWe had the tasting selections ($15) and everything was great, the cheeseburger which was absolutely delicious, and the lobster cheeseburger which was fantastic too. Here's how you know a restaurant takes pride in their food --- Their kids meals are awesome. The chicken fingers weren't your typical chicken fingers you throw in the french fry oil and just fry up. They were battered actual chicken pieces that made me feel like I should have paid more than the $5 it cost!\nSweet Potato Fries FTW!!!\nThey had a wine bar off in the corner that nobody was sitting at which I thought looked like a great place to sit and have conversations with people... maybe I will try that out soon.\nWonderful atmosphere... wonderful wait staff... wonderful food... will definitely be going back!"

    "text": "So as a special treat I decided to get my kids a donuts for breakfast this morning, so we left the house extra early to give us time to run by the Dunkin Donuts by our house. I pulled up and there were about 5 cars in the drive thru, and I didn't think too much of it, so I pulled in behind them. Before I knew it I had people behind me and I was committed to the drive thru lane. Well, we got trapped in their drive thru lane for so long that by the time I reached the order marquee I was late for work and my son was late for school. And remember that we left early to allow enough time to get donuts and to get to work and school. That's how long we sat in the drive thru! \nFinally I placed my order, I told the employee that I needed 2 frosted donuts; that was it. The employee that took my order sounded like she half asleep and mumbling her words, I suspect SHE was the cause for the long delay today. Anyway, finally at the window I find out from the manager that my simple order of 2 donuts had suddenly morphed into a dozen donut holes and an iced mocha coffee. WTF? I told her that wasn't right and she corrected it and got my children's 2 donuts, but as she was running my debit card another employee, the one I suspected had taken my order in the first place, reached out the window to hand me the iced mocha that I didn't order! I had to refuse that coffee and tell the employee it wasn't mine! \nFinally I got my donuts, but I noticed later I didn't get a receipt. As an apology for the wait (I guess since she didn't specify) the manager said she included a third donut, but honestly, it would be nice if they'd just speed up the drive thru service, especially considering that the way their drive through is positioned, once you are in it, with cars behind you, there in literally no way to exit it early. \nUgh. So frustrating having to explain to my boss that I was late over 2 stupid donuts!"

The bartender (I want to say his name is Cory) was friendly and quick to fill our needs. \nWhile there, the regular patron we were with told us his experiences of the supernatural kind. Apparently, shady things have gone down in the place, and there may or may not be permanent residents not of this world, who haunt the spot and are apt to take down photos hanging on the walls.

The view is spectacular especially during the spring and summer when you can truly enjoy the beautiful weather and scenery. Live music on the weekends which certainly enhances the dining experience. I don't even know where to begin with the food! Inside there is an omlette station where the chef even prepares waffles, french toast and pancakes. There is bacon, sausage, hash browns and oatmeal along with cheese blintzes (heavenly with the accompaning strawberry sauce). Moving more towards the patio, there is a set up with an assortment of fresh cheeses and meats including, but not limited to, brie, goat, manchego, aged cheddar, smoked salmon, beef carpaccio and so on and so on. There is an array of fresh fruit including pineapple, rasberries, blackberries, strawberries, melons, grapes etc. The raw bar has blackened ahi, shrimp cocktail, snow crab claws and more. Outside, there is a prime rib carving station, fresh crab cakes, filet mignon medallions, swordfish, snapper, shrimp scampi and scallops. There is a pasta station where a woman mixes in desired toppings with a marinara or an alfredo sauce. Next to her a lovely woman makes homemade tortillas which she makes into quesadillas or tacos with fresh salsas and guacamole. Im sure there are many items that I am forgetting! Moving on to dessert, there is a chocolate fountain with fruits and cookies and rice krispies to dip! There is also ice cream and a made to order bananas foster station. There is also a setup of pastries and cheesecakes and cupcakes and more! \nHonestly this is one of my absolute favorite brunch spots, and my boyfriend and I truly enjoy every second of this amazing feast. Of course the bottomless mimosas dont hurt! For special occasions this is my go to choice, or for the relaxing sunday brunch date with a significant other or a group of friends, Rita's kitchen truly caters to every group!"

The stage is impressive, with very professional lighting and music and special effects. They have live singers and one guy who plays guitar, which is kinda cool, I guess. \nBut overall, this show left me going \"Meh.....\"\nThe main plus is that the showroom is very conveniently located right next to the parking garage, so you don't have to go through the casino to get there.

They were served to me in a bowl and hadn't been drained. One of the eggs was cracked and it was like poached egg soup. What the gross! My friend stated that her meat had no seasonings. The biscuits and gravy were meh (how is there no sausage in the gravy?!). If you order something called huevos Mexicanos, you'd expect it to pack some heat! Not at Sucks and Yucks. Bland and subpar are it's speciality. Home fries which had nothing home-y about them. Not even a sprinkle of salt. Are y'all afraid of the spice rack or some shit? It was just bad, bad, bad.

From the outside you would drive right by it, which we did, and when you pull up in front of the place you would wonder how good can this be. Also you will wonder if your car and/or stereo will be there when you get back. Yes the neighborhood is a little scary and the strip mall this place is located in is a little run down. Then you walk in the front door after you tell yourself hey we are here we are going in no matter what. Once you enter you feel like you just stepped through the wardrobe or something. Very nice and clean inside. The decor is excellent. Lots of fake doors and house facades around the either inside. Also some trinkets on the walls but not a lot like some wanna be sports bar.\nWe are here for the first UYE International Supper Club. This turned out to be a great way to kick this off. I have never had Bosnian food before so I didn't even know what to order. Couldn't even pronounce half the things on the menu. Luckily there are also basic English translations on the menu as well. I couldn't quite decide what to get and neither could one of my fellow dinners so we decided to split the Bosnian Sausage Sandwich and the Beef Patty Sandwich, which we added cheese and mushrooms too. The prices are great. Very inexpensive. So far so good.\nThen the food starts arriving. Someone orders some stew and that smelled and looked good. Then my food arrived. Looked good. Can't wait to try it. My fellow dinner and I each cut the sandwiches in half and traded halves. Upon first inspection the Beef Patty Sandwich looked like ooey gooey goodness but the sausages in the Bosnian Sausage Sandwich looked like store bought heat and serve sausages. What was going on here. But the first bite obilderated that thought. These were so far away from heat and serve sausages it wasn't even funny. One of my favorite sayings is It is so good you punch a hole in the wall. Well this was so good you would tear the whole wall down. I can imagine having these sausages on a breakfast plate. They would be great anywhere. Of course the Beef Patty Sandwich was as advertised. Ooey gooey goodness. They should make a combo plate of half of each sandwich and put it on the menu. So good. Every bite more delicious then the last. I was sorry to finish them. I wanted more. \nThen of course I had to get some Baklava for dessert. For $2 how can you say no. This continued the delicious train. Some of the best I have had.\nThis place made my list of new favorite places. The service was great. Food was awesome. Small little hole in the wall mom and pop place. Total surprise. I will definitely be back. I think my fellow dinners liked it as much as I did. There were clean plates and smiles all around. Thank you to Ursula D. and Monica O. for setting this up. It was a great idea and a good find. Can't wait for the next UYE International Supper Club. Can't wait to come back here again."

The nigiri is overstuffed with rice and can barely make out the taste of the fish. Read this article below, I have never gotten sick from Sushi until now.\n\"When sushi is handled properly in a reputable establishment by a master sushi chef, the risk of getting a food-borne illness from eating it is extremely rare. According to FDA statistics, you have a much greater chance of getting sick from eating poultry or beef than from eating raw fish. But if you eat a spoiled piece of sushi, you won't care about statistics.While you can't possibly know if the raw fish was kept adequately refrigerated or whether the server or preparer properly washed his hands before handling your food, you can use your powers of observation to discover clues that may help you prevent putting your gastrointestinal health at the mercy of a less-than-reputable sushi restaurant\" -eHow"

I'm a huge supporter of local music.\nMeatheads is a small, skinny bar. At the end is where they have their concerts and they have comedy nights (so I've heard, but have not seen). It's in a strange location, in a large Wal-Mart shopping complex, shoved in between a Jamba Juice and a Panda Express. Makes me wonder if the bar had been there for awhile and then those chains just popped up later...\nAnyway, it's a nice little neighborhood bar. The bartender was attentive for the most part. However - the fact that this place hosts bands is just so weird to me. The tiny space just does not make is very conducive. BUT I still had a good time and maybe being crammed into such a small place had a little bit of charm, like \"oh we're all getting in here to see this band and listen to the music and it's gonna be loud and in your face!\".\nIt's a bit far away from where I live and I doubt I'd ever go back there just to have a drink and hang out.

I would stick to buffet here, considering even asking for onions/jalapenos (a common complimentary add-on from Indian restaurants) would run you an extra $2-3 dollars. Furthermore, the portions are not quite right from the entrees, so buffet is best:\nMonday - Friday: $8.95 lunch buffet\nSaturday: $9.95 lunch buffet\nSunday: $12.95 lunch buffet (includes beverage)\nUltimately, this place works if you are really craving Indian, but I have yet to find a consistently fantastic Indian spot in Charlotte.

I am a big Mexican food fan and I think it's pretty hard to find a good Mexican place in North Carolina. I guess I've been spoiled since I lived in Arizona for a couple of months and have had it in California and Texas.\nNonetheless... out of all of the Mexican restaurants I have been to in NC, this one is my favorite. \nThe first night we went, they had a guacamole cart and someone making it fresh in front of us. It was very good. In fact, it was the first time that my wife tried it - and she is a pretty picky eater - but she liked it. I didn't find it overly salty and the flavors all balanced each other out. \nI always judge a Mexican restaurant by the salsa. I personally like spicy stuff, so when the salsa is bland, I can pretty much count on the meal being bland. And that's NOT what Mexican food is supposed to be! That's what American food is. :-)\nThe salsa here is very good - cilantro, diced tomatoes, onion, and of course - tomato. It was decently spicy too but not overly spicy. \nI have had tacos, an enchilada, a chile relleno, and an avocado tostada. The tacos were really good, pretty standard but they had good flavor. I usually don't like enchiladas, but I liked the one I had here. I wasn't a huge fan of the chile relleno because it wasn't just a pepper with meat and cheese... it had some sort of batter that it was cooked in. I guess that's the style down here since the other places I have been had it the same way. \nThe avocado tostada (my meal for tonight) was very delicious. I hadn't ever had that before, so I was being a little adventurous. It had a corn tortilla on the bottom, and was topped with chicken, lettuce, tomato, and salsa. Everything was very good.\nI will definitely be back and I hope that they stick around for a while!"

    "text": "I moved to Seattle after living in Pittsburgh for 25 years. The Grand Concourse WAS one of the best places to have a buffet brunch. It might still be a decent brunch buffet but no way am I coming back to find out. \nI'm visiting from Seattle for the holiday weekend. We did not come for brunch. We came today for my sister's birthday -- which also happened to fall on Labor Day. It was the lunch menu. \nI'll start off by saying that the two stars are solely because the dessert was free and that they sat us in the river room so we had the view of the city. \nI will also make the point that I am a pretty food-conscious and flavor mindful enthusiast who really doesn't mind occasionally dropping a couple bucks for some artful presentation and effort. We had originally wanted to go to Eleven, but they were booked solid for brunch. \nOur waitress began our experience by telling us that since it was a birthday table, we would receive the dessert for free. When we replied that was nice, she continued on to announce, \"yeah it's awesome because the management never used to do that but the servers took a poll and voted that birthday tables should have free dessert.\" Well good, now that you've announced blatantly that you don't mind knocking the dessert off your already completely overpriced 4top tab, we will be sure to give you cool points. (Thought that was a bit out of place to begin with.)\nWe then proceeded to order gazpacho and my mom, the lobster bisque -- which was decent and the gazpacho was tasty but the portion was slightly large for an appetizer and the consistency was more like eating a bowl of salsa, which I didn't like, but my dad and sister didn't mind. My mom enjoyed her lobster bisque just fine but said it wasn't anything special. It wasn't. I could tell by looking. \nSpeaking of lobster, upon entering we also passed a dingy lobster tank and I got a daunting feeling at that early moment. Come on. If you are going to be 1980s tacky and display them in a tank for the public to see, at least clean it!\nAt this point in our meal, the waitress asked us if we wanted bread. We said we did and she said it would be a couple minutes because they had just put it in the oven. 25 minutes went by without bread. At one point when she walked past the table and asked if we were needing anything I said politely that we were fine and that we were just waiting for the bread basket, thinking she had forgotten. She replied shortly, \"So am I.\"\nOk then, ma'am. Hopefully the person who p*$$ed in your cereal this morning didn't do the same in my entree. \nThe Special of the day was Sockeye Salmon -- entitled \"Salmon of the Angels.\" Being that I have lived in Seattle for two years, Alaskan Sockeye is one of my favorite dishes, no matter how it is prepared and I was excited to have it available. The entree was priced at 30 dollars, which is about double what it would be in a location closer to the source so I thought nothing of it and figured a landlocked city would have to price for importing as well. The description said it was served with angel hair in a cream sauce and Parmesan encrusted shrimp. \nWhen it arrived, it was the most insulting experience of all. The salmon was about shy of four ounces and cooked through and sat atop a huge pile of pasta that looked like ramen noodles mixed with what looked like Prego pasta sauce, sour cream, and canned stewed tomatoes. Around the plate were placed three deep-fried shrimp that looked like the kind of basket food you get at Long John Silvers. So it was basically a cheap pasta dish, with a chunk of salmon on top and deep-fried shrimp. Gag. \nI noticed that one of the 15 dollar lunch entrees was fried shrimp and I thought immediately that the shrimp on my plate was probably the same shrimp used for the other lunch entree. \nSimply inexcusable -- just plain wrong. A thirty dollar entree should be a prize. I thought this was a chefs restaurant but apparently it is no longer. \nNext time I'll just deal with the fact that I couldn't get a reservation for Eleven or Avenue B and forget it. \nAt this point the waitress never asked us if we wanted another drink, another glass of wine, nope. I wanted one but there was no way this place was getting any more of my money. I am the kind of person who pays for quality and it would have been fine if it was worth the price, but we were robbed.\nWe waited again for her to bring the check and even then she had to come back to grab our food to box it before bringing the bill. She didn't even have the kitchen label which to-go box of ours was which when we ordered the same. \nLastly, I'll say that I feel as if the service might have been worse because it was a holiday. Please do not hire servers who show their disdain for working on holidays to their table. I worked at a top restaurant on Seattle's Eastlake, and our owners would not have tolerated that for one shift. But then again we also served food that fit the description and priced it accordingly."

First of all they didn't bring me everything that was listed for #34.. I didn't understand why they served a salad without the dressing. ?__?\nThe food was just okay, I'm definitely not satisfied with my choice, but this restaurant was recommended by friends. I guess if I ever come back, it would be for a bowl of soup (you can't go wrong with a bowl of pho).\nYes this restaurant is nice, but I felt like I should have went elsewhere.\nSupposedly this place is open 24 hrs, that's pretty convenient."

Two others in my party had salads that they raved about.\nIf I were at the Silverton Casino during odd hours, I would go here, but it is an average casino cafe.

We ordered the cold Korean noodle and their mixed BBQ platter which consists of the short ribs, meat jun and chicken breast. You can tell they take pride in their BBQ as each piece was grilled to perfection. I really enjoyed the meat jun (Seasoned ribeye dipped in egg before pan frying) especially with their dipping sauce. The banchan (free refill) that came before the meal was also delicious, well seasoned bean sprouts, kim chee and radish. The owner/server was very nice to us and even gave my wife an extra cup of their specialty Korean tea to go. We also had some fresh peanuts that just finished boiling in Hawaiian sea salt. All this for $20, not a bad deal at all. We will definitely be coming back to try out more of their menu items. \n________________________________________"

Their shelves are stocked but I can never see myself coming here for groceries. Minus a star :(\nAll that said, I was desperate on the Friday before Christmas as I needed fresh basil. I managed to score the last package at Sprouts but I then proceed to dash all over the Biltmore area in search for the second package. No luck at Safeway, Fry's or Basha's. On a whim I popped into Luci's and scored the fresher looking of two packages of basil that looked sadly beyond their shelf lives. At this point though, I had no choice.\nThe young guy who rang me up noticed the sorry state of my basil and after determining the poor quality of the other package proceeded to go into the store room and return with another package of FRESH fresh basil. OUTSTANDING service and attention to detail that would have been overlooked anywhere else. ADD 2 STARS for being exceptional!\nI still don't think that all of my grocery needs will be met here and I don't think that that is their goal. But I appreciate exceptional service like I received here so I plan to purchase what I can here. If nothing else, it's a perfect time to go back and sample their menu.\nWell done Luci's!"

Bob really is passionate about what he does and doesn't carry the pretentiousness that other people at certain stores in the CU area have.\nArguably one of the best parts of the store is the $1 section on the second level. This section isn't just Christmas and easy listening - there's a huge varied selection of stuff from all genres. Nicer copies of certain popular/common records might be a little overpriced, but you can usually find a copy of the same record in the $1 bin on the second floor in similar if not lesser condition. \nIn addition, the selection of new stuff is getting better.

Sop all this up with generous serving of pita wedges. Feel free to ask for me, if you run out of pita wedges. And while you're at it, sample their hummus; choose from the traditional, or be bold and try whatever wacky-yet-gastronomically-awesome combination the Mad Hummus Scientist in the back's whipped up for you.\nMain course, I can't stay away from the grilled chicken breast gyro. Generous, and I mean GENEROUS servings of diced chicken breasts, smothered (but not drowned) in tzatziki. DELISH! \nYou gotta have their hand-cut fries. Sure, you can play it safe and order the plain hand-cut fries, but be bold, the same way our Greek forefathers were bold, and plop your pretty little face into a basket of the lemon oregano fries. I could make a meal out of these delish little delights on a daily basis. Who cares if my arteries clog up with thick coats of peanut oil and lemon oregano? You only live once.\nEverything here is clearly fresh and homemade, and if you the Greeks, you know they take their food seriously. They respect the dish, and you better damned well respect the dish too! Their homemade hummus and tzatziki is available for take out as well, so pick some up for home. Perfect for entertaining guests. Or yourself. Whatever works.\nI also love the contemporary Greek pop music that's piped in on some Sirius XM radio feed. I'm noshing on my grilled chicken breast gyro and bopping my head to some Greek version of \"Call Me Maybe,\" and it occurs to me that my bopping may be misconstrued as mockery. Oh, come on! I love \"Call Me Maybe,\" especially when sung in another language!\nAlso, as a side note, I've seen Steve Smith of the Panthers eat here a couple of times. If this place is good enough for the best player ever to wear a Panthers jersey (and why am I gushing, considering I'm a lifelong Giants fan?), then Greco Fresh Grille is good enough for me.\nAnother also: Steve Smith is really short for a wide receiver.

My sister likes this place for happy hour with drinks and such, but we sat in the dining room. The hostess said they didnt have time to set up our table so they just brought silver ware on napkins and set it down. I thought that was kind of rude but all is good. Just simply my opinion.\nChips, salsa and bean dip, FABULOUS. Absolutely delicious. I enjoy great starters like that.\nIt was a Saturday night so they were busy but the place was not packed and there was no wait or line to sit. Our server was really nice, but she was so slow. Serving and having that nack for it is an art, but it is teachable. My family has been servers and in the industry for years so we understand the gist of it. She probably did not get proper training because she was so unorganized, and it took multiple questions and attempts for her to follow though to bring us anything before she took off running before we were even done talking. She was really nice and I know she is trying to make ends meet, but the service was bad.\nMom had the chicken chimichunga. It was under cooked, flat and absolutely tasteless. I split the carne asada burrito with my partner. I enjoyed it, but the steak (in my opinion) was too big. I am used to it being cut up smaller, but it was hardly stuffed with steak and it was flat. Rice and beans were pretty good, but overall dinner was very disappointing. I felt horrible that night and was bloated. My system just did not agree.\nOverall, the evening was not bad. Just frustrating with the lack of service, and so-so quality of the food. You could tell the restaurant was very unorganized and no one knew what was going on. There was a table of 6 who left about 30 minutes after we got there, (they were done) and it took over 20+ minutes for the table to even get cleaned and reset while I watched a part of 6 or 7 sit up front for over 20 minutes, and there were some other free tables. We also watched food get brought to the wrong table over 3 times. So even though we were in our own world, seeing all this took away from the experience.\nI am not sure if I recommend this place or not. I felt horrible after I ate there but I may give them another shot in the future. I was only here once, but to me, first impressions are everything. They are in a great location and I hope they read these and will work on improving their food and system of running the restaurant."

I'm glad we didn't leave cause the food was great.

You walk up to the counter, pick your ice cream from probably about a dozen flavors, and then pick your mix-ins from a variety of candy, fruit, and crushed up candy bars. The ice cream professional behind the counter then mixes them all together in front of you before handing you your frozen treat in either a bowl or waffle cone. The portions are usually very generous and the service tends to have a little pizazz thrown in.\nThis particular Marble Slab seems to excel at the service aspect. The ice cream is good, but what I really noticed was the service. There were 3 groups of people in line all at once, with probably about 8 people total. Even though there was only 1 guy on at the time, he still kept up with all of us at once, giving out samples, making ice cream, and ringing people out, and none of seemed to get bored or antsy waiting on him. \nThe 1 complaint I have is that they need a greater variety of non-dairy treats. My wife does not eat dairy products and her choices were limited to 2 flavors of a type of sorbet. It was good, but more choice would be nice."

Happy Valley Road to The Boulders will give you a great view of desert scenery and the mountains of the area (McDowell Mountains, Pinnacle Peak and Lone Mountain). But in order to appreciate Sonoran Desert beauty at a deeper level, you have to go to the visitor parking and exhibit area on the east side of Scottsdale Road about 1/4 mile south of Jomax Road. Signs and displays in this area will acquaint you with the common flora and fauna of the Sonoran Desert, and you can use this as a starting point for a desert walk along the Scenic Drive's mostly paved sidewalk/trail along N. Scottsdale Rd., with many signs identifying the desert plants along the way. Don't forget to bring plenty of water and wear a hat and sunscreen, though, if you do plan to take the hike. You can cap your trip to the area by dining and shopping at El Pedregal at the Boulders, at the northern end of the Scenic Drive."

She didn't even give me time to open my menu before asking for my order, and at the time the dining area was not busy. I then had to wait a while before she came back to take my order. Over twenty minutes went by and our server checked on all of the tables in our area except for us, we sat with empty glasses until a different server came around. My sons order finally came and mine was wrong so I waited another 15 minutes for my order. Once we finished eating we sat for another 15 minutes before a different server asked if we wanted our check. We were told the computers were down, though I watched patrons who arrived after us receive their checks, pay and leave before Stevie even brought mine over. What was supposed to be a quick trip to IHOP ended up being a frustrating meal with a bored three year old that took over an hour and a half. Simply acknowledging your guests and being attentive would have made us happy, but the service we received was beyond poor."

Funny how it's just a small thing like a 45 minute wait (and not even getting served) that'll make you realize you're giving a place way too many chances.\nIt you want a place that's slow and hurts you to the point where you're telling the laughing man to knock it off, this is the place for you. If you want blood on your feet and a permanent reminder of your inflicted injury, you can't go wrong with TK Nails.\nI tried to give this place a chance. I really did. I gave them a few chances in fact. I read the reviews about infection and poor equipment but it was in the area and had SOME good reviews. There were a few times where the service was acceptable but overall... Oh what a waste of time it is.\nLet's start with the broken down massage chairs when the control panels are gone in certain spots. Yes, you can see the electronics in the control pads. \nAlright, that's just aesthetics, right? Well... how about the broken rollers that leave two streaks of bruises on your back? I looked like two motorcycles rode on my back. I itched for about a week as the skin heals.\nSerious... kudos! A nail salon managed to inflict back injury! I'm amazed at your abilities.\nFine. I won't use the massage chairs and just concentrate on the nails. Massage chairs are nice but you go to get your nails done. Sure, there's the whole experience and it would be NICE to feel pampered but OK... forget about that and just go with a business mindset of getting your nails done.\nNope. It still falters.\nLet's get to the service. THESE PEOPLE WILL HURT YOU. I don't mean, \"Eh... that sorta stung!\" No. You will see BLOOD on your feet and wince in pain. I am not sensitive to pain. My own doctor tells me I have a high pain threshold. Yet that ability is taxed here. \nTelling them to please be gentle doesn't work. They give the universal nervous laugh for everything.\n\"Stop! You are hurting me!!!\"\nHa... ha ha!\n\"No. I'm serious. There is BLOOD!\"\nHa... ha ha!!!\nSpeaking of blood, I still have a permanent tattoo of when they rubbed my BONE on my ankle with a pumice stone. Check out my photo if that hasn't been removed. \nThat area of the foot doesn't need to be smoothed out! The backs of my feet and such? Sure. The bone that sticks out? Why are you rubbing it? It just shows the laziness and lack of attention.\nThen I told him he caused it.\nHa... ha ha!!! No. I didn't do that. Ha... ha ha!!!\n\"Yes. You did!\"\nNo... Ha... ha haa!!!\nThen there's the sticking the \"scooper\" way into your nails. If you ever read history books where people were tortured with bamboo under the nails and went: \"Gee... I wonder what that feels like?\", TK Nails can give you a small taste. \nWhile not as severe I'm sure as the intentional torture, it'll give you a small taste for free. Thanks for letting me experience that.\nIf you still want to go, then be prepared to wait. Truthfully it was foolish for me to give as many chances as I did. \nWhen you're just sitting there you have plenty of time to think.\nI sat there and went... \"WHY am I here again? Why am I even waiting? I thought about the blood, permanent tattoo, marks from the chair and general slowness and walked out.\nTerrible, terrible place."

I've long lamented Charlotte's distinct lack of affordable, independent Italian restaurants and here, 5 minutes walk from my home was this Elysium of Mediterranean awesomeness.\nI went with my girlfriend, who happens to be a foodie from the Greater Philly area, which I'm quite sure is enough to qualify her as a de facto expert on Italian cuisine. We were both highly impressed every step of the way. We ordered the fried calamari appetizer and were presented with what can best be described as little rings of crispy perfection...and marinara, of course. The only calamari I've ever had that came close was from an outdoor restaurant in Marrakech. (Pro-tip: don't order squid in landlocked, Islamic cities. Whether or not the Koran forbids squid may be debatable. What is certain is that, however delicious, you will get sick. I leave it to you to work out the cost-benefit analysis there).\nHer Chicken Francese with fettuccine was the sort of thing that might have been painted on the Sistine Chapel ceiling had Michelangelo not been employed by clerics to paint religious imagery instead. Might The Creation of Adam have been painted with a flying fettuccine monster in place of God? Alas, we will never know.\nMy Chicken Marsala with gnocchi was even better. Sorry for having to be so terse about it. I can say no more without getting choked up, and I'm at work. Just order it. It will change you.\nIn true American fashion, the servings were so large we both had plenty left over to take home but couldn't resist putting Villa Francesca through the ultimate test of Italian restaurants, the cannoli. Having never had one that wasn't soggy, way too sweet or both, I was doubtful I'd enjoy it. Wrong again, Bob! They don't fill their cannoli until they're ordered and for once, I didn't feel like I was flirting with diabetes with each bite. It was transcendent. \nI will have to try the pizza next. If everything I've tried so far is any indication, I've probably found my new favorite pizza place as well. And to think, I've been going to Fuel all this time!"

We asked to be moved to another room or place and they moved us to the corner which was a little better.

With the help of our waitress we tried six dishes with two orders of each for four of us. The dishes are listed below in terms of how we liked them.\n1. Eggplant Canneloni--outstanding dish with a lot of good flavors. Different and delicious. I am not a lover of eggplant and I loved this dish.\n2. Snapper Mini-Tacos--Also very good--good fish, spicy and very tasty. Would definitely order this again\n3. Braised Short Rib--Tender, tasty and very good overall.\n4. Latin Yucca Frites--I liked this better than my friends but they could have been better. Prepared in an oil type marinade that was mostly at the bottom, meaning the frites at the bottom had the full effect and those were good. Uneven dish.\n5. Stuffed dates with Pancetta--another very unusual dish. Okay but not anything I would have again. Nice blend with Pancetta and gorgonzola--date was very sweet--okay but not great.\n6. Lump Crabcakes--we were all disappointed with this dish. Not much crab and the flavor was somewhat bland. \nOverall it was a nice place but with all of the good choices in Scottsdale I am not sure I would go back again."

    "text": "One of the Montreal's most well known steakhouses became the site of our most epic dinner during my friend's bachelor party weekend. In the midst of planning for the dinner, there was a tossup decision between this place and cross town rival Gibby's (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/gibbys-restaurant-montreal). The deliberation ended with Queue de Cheval for one thing: amazing service. From the phone reservation to greeting us at the door to the end of the meal, they did one heck of a job in accommodating our party of 12 hungry men.\nFrom the outside into the lobby, it's easy to see how beautiful this restaurant really is. In true steakhouse fashion, there are various cuts of meat from all parts of the world on display, something a true meat connoisseur can surely appreciate. We were able to get a spot on the second floor facing the street and the restaurant was like many other upscale steakhouses: trendy decor, well dressed patrons and wait staff, a lively ambiance just buzzing with activity. \nGenerally speaking, the food always takes precedence in any restaurant but in places like this, service is of the utmost importance. The wait staff was quick and handled everything with ease, we almost never had to ask for anything as water was filled quickly, bread was refilled automatically, and there was never any attitude. Our main waiter was sharp, humorous, and extremely knowledgeable about virtually every item on the menu and was able to make some killer recommendations for drinks and food. We decided to pass on their appetizers, a majority of which would sully our carnivorous appetite for the one thing we came for - steak. Almost all of us were sold on the 20oz Lou's Cut ($54), which is the place's most popular steak.\nAlong with the steak we ordered multiple sides of creamed corn ($12), truffle and parmesan fries ($7), garlic mashed potatoes ($5), along with a heaping of steak sauces: veal and truffle reduction ($6), cognac peppercorn ($6), and a cabernet sauvignon demi glace ($6) and staring at us was a hell of a meal.\nEverything was fantastic. The creaminess of the garlic mash, coupled by the delicious sauteed garlic spinach was melt in your mouth good. There were multiple foodgasms galore over the Lou's Cut, a hearty Colorado imported hunk of steak heaven in it's medium rare glory, juicy and went great with everything. The steak sauces weren't even all that necessary, but once added, there was no going back. Every bite was enhanced, the flavors were so rich, it was just the perfect amount of food; life was suddenly perfect. \nAlong with the Australian red and whites we sipped throughout the night, including 4 orders every side and a Lou's cut, the price we paid (sans the bachelor of course) was a very reasonable $82 per person. The conversation was as excellent as the food which was stellar as the service. Steakhouses might feel a tad more expensive in Montreal, mainly due to the importing of all of the meat, but when in town, this is one of the best places for steak period.\nHere's a parting thought for everyone: http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/Ek4sVcvmACWp8P1yizjwZg?select=NCkeuXRvI3XEOftyy2x7EQ"

Come here occasionally and about every fourth visit, they go from an acceptable value to absolutely awful.\nTonight was one of those nights.\nHad a craving for sirloin, so I ordered that with baked potato and house salad. We already had onion rings and fried pickles the table that were difficult to eat because they were so salty. Got my salad - this was good with bleu cheese dressing. Ate it all, then came the entree. All I asked for was sour cream and butter on the potato. I added black pepper. Was only able to eat a third of it because someone in the kitchen must own stock in Morton's Salt. The skin was worse, since they roll the taters in salt before cooking. \nOkay... could they screw up a steak that I asked to be cooked rare? I know they aren't equipped to do black and blue, but rare is hard to mess up. Cooked unevenly, one side of the steak was medium rare, the other was medium well. I think there was some medium pink in the middle. Overall, the meat was lukewarm, temperature-wise. Again, it was me having a little food with my salt.\nNo one got their steaks cooked correctly. One asked for medium well and got hers bloody. Different cut, or I'd think they mixed the steaks up. She sent gets back. What she got back looked like it might have been thrown in the microwave. It wasn't gone long enough to have been grilled longer.\nIf not for the usual nice servers, I'd be upset over not giving this place a double zero for stars.\nI ate a third of my main plate because of the extra generous portions of salt. This restaurant must have stock in blood pressure meds.\nTo their credit, they took my meal off the tab and offered me something else because they \"don't want customers leaving hungry.\" I wouldn't have left hungry if they could cook better than a five year old left alone in the kitchen. But I'd rather force a crappy fast food burger down my throat than eat anything more from that kitchen tonight. Already on my fourth glass of water, trying to dilute the salt.\nThe only thing that would have made me happy would have been a future comped meal on a day they had someone cooking who knew what they were doing. Had I taken them up on the offer tonight, I'd not have been able to eat it, no matter how hungry I still was - for all I know, my replacement meal might have been spit in.\nOverall, I've had better meals at Golden Corral - and most of us know how bad that can be.\nThe kids were happy - young people are more salt tolerant, plus their big brownies didn't seem to be loaded with salt.\nSorry, Texas Roadhouse. You'd already lost most of my family and friends. Tonight, even with as tolerant as I am, you finally accomplished losing me, too.\nOne word summary for those skimming this review: YUCK!"

You couldn't miss us.\nWe opted for the outdoor seating, which was very nice under the misters at 6 PM. We had a nice view of a small park area, and while the six adults and 2-year-old sat at one table, the 4-year-olds got their own table right behind us. \nWe had a bottle of a great red wine - the Amarone 2003 Corte Giara. I'm a fan of bold, red wines, but my friend who was there who is more of a white wine person also really liked this wine. \nMy husband and I split the Insalta della Casa - baby greens with tomatoes, cucumbers, olives and red peppers, and we had the creamy gorgonzola dressing. Yum. We also shared a pizza - the Vegetariana. I can't believe I got my pepperoni-only-eating husband to go for this, and it was really great: mozzarella (made in house), provolone, carmelized onions, roasted peppers, and parmigiano reggiano.\nThe kids split their own pizza: a basic cheese pizza with pepperoni on one side. \nThe pizza reminded us of Cibo (which also reminds us of pizza in Italy). The crust is thin but slightly chewy. \nNext time, I want to go back without the kids for the wine-tasting events that they do. I believe the events are the first Sunday of the month, and you get to try 6 or 7 wines (and a friend told me you get more than just a \"taste\" - practically a full glass) plus a course to match each wine. It's a great way to familiarize yourself with the food and wine menu, and it's only $40 a person. There are locations in Old Town Scottsdale and DC Ranch, so if Verrado is way out of the way for you, you can try one of the other locations.\nBut .. the great thing about Grazie in Verrado is two doors down there is a coffee shop that serves gelato. So, after the kids ran around in the fountain (yeah, um, that's what happens when the dads are in charge of the kids while the moms pay), we walked over to get some yummy gelato."

It was good though. \nI settled on the fish tacos with the pico on the side. I got mine fried...but you can order grilled instead. It was good. They were crispy and on traditional corn tortillas with a good, creamy chipotle sauce on top. They had salsa on the side that I used instead of the pico and it was good. It came with a side of pilaf that was tasty too. \nI ordered a cream cheese pumpkin slice of pie to go, because who can pass up pumpkin this time of year. My friend tasted it and said it was very good...even sinful. Can't wait to eat it later!\nService: We had a cutie, young waiter with a very deep voice named Tom. He was friendly and helpful. \nFacility: this place was nicely decorated and had a warm feel. The chairs we pretty comfortable with cushion on the wood and high backs. \nOverall review: it was a little pricey, but the lunch menu wasn't too bad. I liked everything about my experience except for the price. So, I would give them a 4 overall."

And it comes with a drink.\nThere's just something about this place that ever-so-slightly sets it apart from other run-of-the-mill Chinese restaurants (that's a lot of hyphens). They claim to serve \"New York style\" Chinese food. I'm really not sure what that means, but it's working for them. I also appreciate how they serve their to-go food. Instead of the typical styrofoam container, they use aluminum bowls with a plastic cover. I'm not sure if I'm getting more or less food, but it seems like the right amount of food (bordering on the heavy side)."

    "text": "Eesh, I seem to be in the minority here both on Yelp and amongst friends all of whom like this bar. Now, it's not that I actively disliked it. I think my review needs to be understood in the context of what I normally like in an drinking establishment.\nLet's make this on a compliment sandwich...no wait, shooter, to keep it sweet. (This bar has a list of very amusing shooters, which I shall not repeat here, but if you have been or to go this may make more sense):\nThe Jenny-Jelly Shooter\n1/3 Friendly and Cheap\n1/3 Sports Bar Boredom\n1/3 Fun\nThat top layer of quite sickly sweet liquid that you know you're going to like but maybe not for the best reasons (think cherry sours). The bar is welcoming, friendly bar staff, cheap drinks, nice crowd. All of these are good things. You'll find cheap drink, and an impressive range of spirits (red stag, a few different types of vodka). Not your limited standard fare\nThe middle layer of rather overpowering, intoxicating taste that will cause an involuntary nose-wrinkle (perhaps sambuca. I mean who enjoys that?!) This bar has many TVs, of varying sizes, on every wall you look at. Seriously. A huge screen at the end of one 'part' of the bar. Little tvs by the bar, other tvs all around. All showing the same sports channel (it was rugby I think?) If you like sports, this will be great. But if not, it's a little overwhelming. \nAs a result it's a kind of sports bar, with that vibe. People out to drink cheap drink, to get drunk, get a little bit lairy. Substance over style (lots of alcohol substance, not much style). This is perhaps where I sound slightly snobby, but of the two shooters I tried, both werent that enjoyable and a bit sickly (everyone agreed the Cherry one tasted like medicine), didn't get me any closer to being merry and whilst they were cheaper than my beloved margaritas, they were in no way enjoyable so if anything I felt out of pocket.\nSo whilst the drinks are cheap, the whole atmosphere is perhaps equally so. It reminds me of a student union. May suit some tastes, but not mine. This is subjective here. For what it is, it isn't bad.\nIt does, however, have an element of fun that would work on the right occasion. The shooters, as I mentioned, were sickly, sweet and amusingly named. A night that begins here with a few of those and a cheap vodka chaser would probably be a good start to the night. But we ended up here half way through our night, having previously been at better bars so it felt like a step downwards rather than onwards.\nSaying all that, I might start my night here with a big crowd on a fun night out. \nIt's just not a 'Jen-place', so the 2 star rating is because I personally would never suggest coming here or perhaps even look forward to going. But I think if you are looking for particular elements or need somewhere to start a long-night out party, then it'll do just fine.\nBackpackers, ex-pats, crowds of folk, those watching the pennies, those in need of a sports bar with big screens, stag and hen parties and other people less fussy than me may well enjoy it!"

    "text": "I came in upon a friend's recommendation for my annual check up. It was the basic drill. Check in, paperwork, wait, pee in a cup, wait, see the nurse for vitals, undress, wait, see doc, dress, blood work, pay, reschedule. Clearly, those are a lot of steps with different people in different rooms of the office. The problem is that no one bothers to tell you where to go or what to do next. If you are brand new to the office, you better buck up and figure it out yourself. Don't bother asking for help. Asking questions only irritates the staff and they aren't shy to show you that they think you are stupid for not knowing their exact urine sample procedures. Grrrr!\nSo the doctor was nice enough...no complaints on that front. The girls in the blood lab were really the only people with any personality, compassion or care at all. I ended up getting a follow up call on the blood work that turned out to be nothing thankfully. However, I was appalled at the process. They left and abrupt, alarming and very vague voice mail. When I called back, I got lost in their automated system and then put on hold for an eternity. They finally asked me who had called me...needed the name of the nurse. I was like...\"I don't know. Can't you look me up? Don't you have a computer?\". After much haggling I finally spoke to someone who could tell me what was wrong with me. Well, that's an overstatement. I asked a couple of elementary questions and the lady couldn't answer a thing and recommended that I go to WebMD to get answers. Really? \nSo, I came back for a follow up visit, hoping the experience would be more pleasant. It wasn't as bad, but certainly substandard. Coming to the lady-doctor isn't my favorite thing to do. It's not comfortable or enjoyable. A good practice in my opinion would compensate with outstanding customer service. Cornerstone could use a little...er a lot...of training in the way of customer service."

The bread was ok. I've heard the Symphony and Encore are pretty good too.\nThe chocolate chip cookie that comes with the sandwich is bonus, but one time I got exactly one chocolate chip in the cookie. WTF?

They even carried Opus X. Their staff was great and incredibly knowledgable.\nThe mojitos are a bit pricey- but hey, after having three or more, you're bound to forget that. 12 year old rum and mint muddled just right.

Their pineapple mojito was also very good, not overly sweet to the point that you couldn't appreciate the rum any longer. The wait staff was attentive and made sure we were well hydrated :] \n4 stars because it can get incredibly crowded in there and sadly, their port selection was miniscule.

And, a lot of people would rather chose those spots to eat at, rather than go to LoS which they feel is overhyped. I've been to a lot of those places as well.. So what's the conclusion? I don't think this place is overhyped at all. I believe that LoS deserves every single accolade it has received. It probably deserves more..\nPlaces like Komol, Weera Thai, Pan Asian, Archi's etc. etc., they make really good, in fact, they make really great Thai food! LoS is completely on an entirely different level. For example, take the classic, drunken noodles. At all the great Thai restaurants, they all make excellent versions of this dish, and they each have a common trait that says \"this is drunken noodles.\" At LoS, it still says \"this is drunken noodles\", but it's totally different from every one I've ever had in my life. And, I mean different in a totally amazing, uniquely personal, life changing sort-of-way... That goes for EVERY dish on the menu. Also, if you haven't had the crispy prawns, do try them, quite possibly the best thing I've eaten this year (them prawn shells..)\nWhenever I eat at a restaurant, I always come in with an open mind regardless of what others have experienced, positive or negative.

He cuts the soles at the right point so they don't show when you're standing but still protects the bottom from rocks and scuffing. \nI've been bringing my loubs to him for years and I'm always happy!\nLove this guy!!"

I am always willing to please my clients and give them my service with a smile This place on the other hand is NOT! The owner and staff is absolutely unprofessional and rude. She and the people that work there have NO sense of costumer service or good business sense. We took our dogs there for the second time and went through the most unbelievably horrid experience. We drooped our two large dogs off at 8:30 am. Two hours later we received a phone call at 10:30am to let us know that our lab was done BUT the Akita was not. He was not done because the owner wanted to let me know that she was not going to honor the previous grooming price that was written on his card. She continued to tell me, with a nasty attitude that she was going to charge me more and if I didn't want to pay more than I could come pick up the dog. We decided that the business etiquette was so horrendous that we were going to pick them up. When we arrived at the shop..we were promptly told in our face that we were charged $50 last time..where they then showed us the amount charged as $50 on his client card. How can a business literally show us what they charged last time then argue that they were holding my dog hostage id we did not pay MORE? Who does that??Then AMAZINGLY owner and another worker attacked me verbally and laterally GOT IN MY FACE to block my way to leave. I absolutely cannot believe this place is in business. This was the absolute WORST place i have ever spent my hard earned money and i would N E V E R recommend anyone to EVER go there!"

Great sound system and stage with lots of pretty LED lights. Only downside here is the smallish main dance floor which gets super crowded and forces security to cut off people. You can still hear the music outside in the day club area but it's not the same. If you find yourself downstairs in the hip hop room at Marquee, you're probably doing it wrong but to each their own.\nHaven't had bottle service here yet but one sure way to skip the lines is to hop on the presales sold through their website, guy or girl. If they aren't at capacity, there's in and outs the back way by the Boulevard Pool, where presales enter.\nDon't miss Kaskade when he's spinning here, or any other top 100 DJ for that matter. The clubbing crowd can be a mixed bag of like minded music lovers to super douchey bro types. However, don't let that get you down, Vegas is still learning to embrace EDM."

I also had the spaghetti with lemon and shrimp which was excellent. My wife had the margherita pizzette which she really liked. For her main course, she has the rigatoni with the vegetable bolognese which was also really good. \nTHE BAD\nWhile the food was really good, the service was a bit lacking. Our waiter was attentive and did a pretty good job during dinner. He forgot to come back to the table to ask my wife what glass of wine she would prefer after serving mine to me. At the beginning of the meal, the waiters are required to present a pre-fixe menu at $120/person which includes an autographed picture of Giada. The way this is presented in a leatherette binder is completely cheesy. You would think that he is presenting the Holy Grail to you.\nTHE UGLY\nWhen we had finished our dinner, the waiter asked of we were interested in dessert. We told him that we were and a guy proceeded to wheel a cart of desserts over. He reviewed the desserts with us and I chose chocolate gelato. Instead of going to the kitchen to retrieve the desserts, he proceeded to scoop out the gelato from a metal container on the dessert cart. The container was not chilled because the gelato was mostly melted and placed on our table. All of the desserts are served from the cart. And the cart is sitting out the entire night near the entrance to the restaurant which allows all of the desserts to come to room temperature and most of the desserts are uncovered all night. It is quite disgusting!!\nIf you go here, avoid dessert!"

As far as actually getting pierced I've only dealt with Ana and she was amazing. Even as a man in his 40's I admit I still get a little nervous when sitting down to get pierced but Ana has an amazing talent for putting people at ease. She is definitely one of the most interesting people I've ever met and I could sit for hours and listen to her philosophy on life. Conversations with her are so engaging that I almost forget why I came there in the first place and before I know it it's done and she's giving me aftercare instructions.

I told her I would have appreciated being able to find a fast checkout experience. She became very short with me and told me that it wasn't her fault because she did not write the schedule! Her rude response was completely uncalled for. \nThe other 24 hour grocery store in the area leaves the self checkouts open all night. That way they are able to provide an efficient and courteous checkout experience to their customers regardless of when they shop. My experience at this particular Vons shows providing customers with an efficient and courteous checkout experience is not a high priority to the Safeway corporation.\nHopefully this information serves one of two purposes. Either it causes your corporation to reexamine the customer experience provided in your stores. Or it will cause large amounts of Facebook and Yelp! users to realize that maybe Albertson's or the Kroger subsidiaries are better choices when one expects customer service out of their grocery shopping experience."

Nope, these aren't the overly sweet, garishly hued cocktails that you used to THINK were tiki, these exotic cocktails are made from the recipes of none other than Trader Vic and Beachbum Berry and from various classic 40's, 50's and 60's tiki bars that created the laid-back, liquid lifestyle that is tiki.\nOn a recent Thursday my cocktail of choice was Planter's Punch - and yes, it certainly packed one. A punch, that is. I've also enjoyed a Hurricane - nope, not the Hawaiian punch-colored (and, unfortunately, flavored, too) sort, but a REAL Hurricane made with fresh-squeezed juices; a lovely Mai Tai; a Lucky original with coconut, coffee, rums and I'm not sure what else - amazing; a Jet Pilot; Grog...and so, SO many others. \nWhether your choice of poison is a Sufferin' Bastard, a Zombie (enjoyed by many on Halloween, no less!), Singapore Sling, or a Mai Tai...whether it comes in a tiki mug or a glass adorned with colorful paper umbrellas, cherries, wheels and wedges of citrus, fancy straws or even a tall, spiky pineapple leaf...whether you come with a group or all by your lonesome, you WILL enjoy the cocktails and the company of fellow tiki-philes. \nMaking Thursday evenings even more special are the exotic sounds of DJ Dr. Zombo who sets the tiki mood with South Seas sounds and surf rock. Gotta love those marimbas and jungle bird calls! And if you're REALLY fortunate, you might hit on a night when Dr. Zombo breaks out the guitar and joins fellow musicians for surf rock sounds by Vertigo Go!\nYou can get tiki drinks at the Tiki Lounge any day of the week, but ONLY on Thursdays from 4-9 pm can you get the best of the best of tiki cocktails made by masters. Need a get away? This is it! Sigh...I only wish EVERY night was a South Seas night."

The drawback is that you would have to wake up extra early to try and squeeze in one more meal on Monday morning.\nBacchanal has the most insane surcharge.

We tried every single type of meat and then asked for seconds, thirds and more of our favorite ones. It's definitely a carnivore's dream as you can eat and eat and eat as much meat as you possibly can stuff your face with. \nThe only drawback to this place is that I feel that the meats are a bit over seasoned and on the saltier side.

However this past weekend my good friend was having his bachelor party there and we needed to hit up Wet Republic. When I go somewhere I prefer to go there the right way, at Wet Republic this means we needed a cabana. I tried booking directly through Wet Republic but they could not give a firm commitment that my reservation would be confirmed. I understand that Cabanas at Wet Republic are a hot commodity, but I was willing to pay them 5 grand up front in cash! Still, they would not commit to honoring the reservation if the day off someone came along and outbid me. Most places this type of business practice would be frowned upon, but hey, this is Vegas. Enter VIPNVegas, I called these guys to see if they could give me a straight answer and a firm commitment. I spoke to Rich and told him what I wanted, he gave me a price, along with a written commitment to honor my reservation. Some of you may think this is strange, but a group of 20 guys is typically not going to get in Wet Republic, especially their most coveted Cabana area, Let me also say this was the weekend of the biggest boxing match of the year, which was also held at MGM. So basically this was one of Wet Republics biggest weekends. Rich told me, just meet me in front of WET Republic at 11:30am and bring your cash. DONE! The day before a member of his team called me to work out all of the logistics and make sure there where no issues. I met Rich with a group of 22 dudes with me and paid him the agreed upon fee, then, all 22 of us walked right through the line to the best Cabana on the property! I was able to book it with a 5K spent minimum, the people at the cabanas next to me all had to spent at least 10K. So not only was Rich more professional to deal with, he was also cheaper! But wait, it doesn't stop there, what if at 2am saturday night you decide you wanna go back to Wet in the morning?? Send RIch a text, problem solved. Sunday morning one the of the VIPNVEGAS crew was there to meet us once again. Simple as pie\n \nVIPNVEGAS does exactly what they say they will do. They operate their business like an actual business, which is rare in their industry. I was never the type of person to use these services because I could usually always get what I needed without them. But after working with them this weekend, they are now programmed in my phone for every Vegas trip moving forward. These guys provide top notch service and provide for a hassle free experience. If anyone has ever tried to get a table or a cabana in vegas before at either a nightclub or pool, then you know it is a three ring circus. These guys deal with the dick head bouncers and VIP managers at all the spots so you dont have to. I highly recommend VIPNVegas for ANY need you have in vegas. From something small like you and a buddy looking for a chill spot, to a full on 30 girl/guy megaweekend. You will not regret it!"

If you wait too long, you're going to be disgusted by what you find in the river -- let's just say that some people don't wait until the tubing trip concludes to use the restroom.\nTubing down the Salt River is definitely an Arizona staple nonetheless. You'll find a mainly college crowd with guys spitting game and women flashing for beer. It's a drunk frenzy but it's definitely one of the more interesting people watching activities out there."

The bar was filled with scantly dressed waitresses who were aloof to what was going on; half of them didn't know what time brunch ended and the other half didn't really know anything about what was on the menu. When we found a booth we asked for brunch menus, however it took three different employees until we actually got a brunch menu and not a regular menu. \nUp until that point I thought I was doomed. It wasn't until we sat and ordered and finally got our food that out experience took a 360 turn for the better. We ended up with a large, comfy leather booth. The food was delicious, I got the French toast and my friend got a breakfast burrito. We also got alcoholic shakes which were very sweet but good. The DJ started plying music during tv commercials and absolutely killed it. \nOverall the experience turned out real good. But due to the poor service, ditsy waitresses and seemingly clueless staff, I give them 3 stars (I would give 3.5 if I could). But pretty delicious food and great DJ for sure."

As soon as you enter there is a huge bar in front of you with unfriendly bartenders whom takes forever to take orders and deliver them it. Besides, on busy nights it is impossible to walk around bar due to lack of space. \nCrowd? Your typical Scottsdale crowd which bounces between El Hefe, Hi Fi and Fire House.

We got a great deal - $320 for 3 nights on Memorial Day weekend! Whaaaatt?! haha. Everywhere else we looked had rooms available for crazy high prices. We felt lucky that we found a suite at the Jockey Club. Like others said, there is no view, but the location is awesome! We were nestled between the Cosmopolitan (connected to the Cosmo and you can get to their casino through the elevator) and Bellagio right on the strip! The suite we stayed in had a full kitchen, living room and walk-in closet. It was a pretty good size for just two people. Grant it there were no toiletries provided (no soap, shampoo, conditioner, etc.) but there were plenty of towels available. There was also a lot of utensils, cups, plates and cookware ready to use. We actually ate in for a couple of our meals! There is also free parking on one level of the Cosmo parking structure reserved just for Jockey Club patrons. And you get to use one of the pools at the Cosmo too, which I recommend since the Jockey Club pool is pretty much like a community center pool. Although when we went, it was crazy busy and there were no chairs available so I'd only recommend the Cosmo pool on non-busy weekends. All in all we enjoyed our stay here and would stay here again. The only downside was the toiletries, the mirror facing the bed (totally bad feng shui), and that the TV is in the living room and not in the bedroom (I like watching tv in bed =P)."

You can walk from the hotel to the show floor in under fifteen minutes. \nThat said, the Westgate is still figuring out what it wants to be. Under new management, the staff seems reinvigorated and focused on making your stay a great one. There's still work to be done, primarily in the room upgrades and the dining options, but I loved the enthusiasm of the team trying to make this a better option for Vegas travelers.\nI stayed in the North tower in one of the renovated rooms, and it was quite nice. Yes, the two beds were only doubles, but the bedding was soft and clean and I had a beautiful view of the mountains to the east. My shower worked great, with hot water available immediately and good drainage in the tub. (Colleagues in the East tower didn't fare as well on that front.)\nOne interesting option at the Westgate is the \"Go Green\" incentive. You can push a \"Green\" button on your phone and opt out of housekeeping services for the day. For this, you get a $10 voucher good for food/drink in the hotel during your stay. This service is not available on check-in or check-out days, so I only used it once, but I absolutely loved it. Bonus - it paid for my coffee at Fortuna (as well as the guest in line behind me) the next day.\nWait times at registration and the taxi stand were never more than five minutes, but the Paradise Cafe fills up for breakfast, so be prepared to wait during peak times. (A better option, grab and go from Fortuna, plus it's open 24-hours.)"

The fish tacos were very good - not great like other menu items. I am a little disappointed that I did not try something new and adventerous since this was my 4th or 5th visit there. They need to do something a little different with the setup of this place. Not horrible but the seating could have a better lay-out and the order/payment lines are a little chaotic.

So last month we came here four different times in the span of 3 weeks and they had the Equate 60 ct. Acid Reducer pills out of stock. HOW CAN THIS BE?\nAnd last but not least: awful, awful employees. I'm going to mirror what another reviewer already said, I know Walmart treats their employees like trash and they deserve better but that doesn't mean you can be rude and unhelpful. No one is forcing you to work there and you are damn lucky to even have a job. Last time we came here, my Nana had asked an employee to help her find some razors and the lady turned her back and ignored her! My Nana found the razors on her own and wasn't afraid to let the lady know. \"I found the razors myself, thanks b****!\" and the lady said nothing. Terrible. I wish I could have been there to get her name to report her. And it comes to a point where I don't care if the employee get's fired. There's NO excuse for that behavior.\nAwful location. The manager should be ashamed to run this store."

    "text": "Another success from Big Burrito. This place is new American at its best (in Pittsburgh). I went twice in a weekend (both celebrating graduation with different people).\nThe first time I ordered the beef carpaccio which was prepared perfectly, in fact, I've never had better. My date ordered a lobster tail in risotto. The lobster was cooked just barely enough to warm it--perfect. She ordered it again on our second trip. I then ordered the pork porterhouse which was perfectly cooked to a medium rare, by the chef's suggestion. She ordered the seafood tasting which consisted of scallop, rare-seared tuna, and a crabcake; all were perfect.\nOn our second visit we brought two others, one a vegetarian. The vegetarian ordered the seafood tasting menu and loved everything except the fried tofu course (a regular tasting menu is also available, along with wine pairings for both menus). I ordered the antipasto which was excellent, however, I would not suggest anyone ordering it by themselves--Eleven should specify on the menu that the antipasto is meant for two because I don't see how one person could possibly eat that much meat, cheese, and pickled vegetables. I then ordered the strip, perfectly cooked to rare. It did not beat my experience with the pork porterhouse just a few nights prior though. The experience around the table was all positive--the veal and lobster was well appreciated as was the roasted chicken.\nThe wine selection is extensive, as should be expected. The desserts are another shining feature of this place. All are made to order (the molten chocolate cakes takes about 10-15 minutes from the time you order).\nUnfortunately, this is not the best New American food I've had and honestly it is pricey (especially the wine), and hence Eleven takes a 4. Regardless, this is about the best dining experience in Pittsburgh. Bottom line--if you need to celebrate, impress a client, or impress a date, go here."

Seating it somewhat limited though as the removed their dining area to make room for two billiard tables. So there's some big chairs and small tables in the bar area, along with a couple of small booths. But that's about it. There is a party room. And there's also some seating outside on the patio when the weather is nice. This is definitely one of the larger PT's locations. The servers are total hit or miss. Sometimes their great and totally attentive. Other times, you have to flag them down every time and there's lots of errors. This is probably my fav PT's to eat at. I love their Southwestern BLT and sweet potato fries. Hint: Get a side of honey mustard to dip the fries in. Overall, this is my 2nd fav PT's around town."

When we arrived it looked very promising a large crowd was gathering next door for the car show and once we entered the place had a very cool atmosphere with \nTV's on every wall,classic 50's \nboothes and all kinds of car memorabilia. Plus \ntheres a bar & game room upstairs. There was no wait & plenty of seating when we arrived at 6:00 pm. After we were seated , 20 minutes later a teenage waitress came to take our drink order, 20 minutes later she came back with the drinks and took our order. We ordered 4 sliders,Fried Cheese, Pork Tenderloin & Country Fried Steak Sandwiches. A little pricier than the menu we had found on the \ninterent but still fairly reasonable. While we waited for our appetizer we saw several disgruntled patrons complaining about the slow service & leaving. After an hour of waiting we still had NOT seen our waitress for a refill or explanation. There were at most 30-40 patrons in the place at this time. The people sitting across from us had to have waited 20 minutes for there bill and finally a \nwaitress brought them every unpaid check and asked which one was theirs, the man left exact cash for the check & voiced quite loudly to no one in particular he wasn't leaving any damn tip-for what? On 2 \noccasions while we were waiting with our EMPTY glasses on the edge of the table as a CLEAR sign we needed MORE to drink the waitresses would turn tail and run before they made eye contact and had to DO THEIR JOB!! Finally fed up with waiting for NO APPARENT REASON we decided to give up and go somewhere that actually serves their customers. We approached the waitress to find out what the problem was she laughed & said \"it's crazy in here\" with no apology or explanation for the ABSURDLY long wait. HELL we've waited an HOUR to get into a place with NO problem but an HOUR to see your waitress after you've ordered-NEVER and we eat out 3-4 times a week! To say it was BAD service is an understatement. We never had a chance to try any of the food but without a doubt there was NO way it would have been good enough to compensate for the \natrocious service. The only way I would recommend this place is if it were FREE & they were POURING booze down your throat while you wait. IF you are looking for a disrespectful smart mouthed teenager to give you SHIT this is your kind of place. BUT if you expect to get what your paying for Quality Food & Service you MOST definitely will NOT find it here."

Maybe because we looked young? Maybe because we were only semi-dressed up? Who knows, but the lounge was great... service was awesome, chairs were comfy, and the guys will love the outfits the waitresses wear in this section. \nComplimentary duck fat fries... to be honest, this wasn't that good! I've had duck fat fries in Chicago and wow, these don't even compare to those. However, they were free, so I'm not complaining. \nKobe tartare... soo.. soo.. good! Very incredible presentation. Comes out on a plate with tons of ingredients around it (mustard, salt, etc) and they mix it into a ceviche looking/dip type stuff tableside and put it in a martini glass over ice..you spread it on hot grilled pita bread. So freaking amazing. \nFor our main course, we got 1 american kobe filet ($72), and the foie gras sliders! Both were so incredible. Steak was the best steak of my life.. hands down, can't compare any other steak to it. Perfectly marbled fat, but still lean.. not an ounce of chewiness. Foie gras sliders were little bites of heaven. I love foie gras, but usually find it way too rich, BUT placed on a bun with a sort of pear mixture, it was flawless. The flavors just worked perfectly. Best presentation of foie gras I've eaten, ever, anywhere. \nDessert was the beignets and creme brulee plate. I consider the beignets in NOLA much much better, but my bf disagreed. These were more dense than the ones I'm used to. \nOverall, can't recommend this place more. Dinner for 2 with 2 cocktails was $200 with tip, however we did split the foie gras sliders and a steak rather than getting 2 steaks. Definitely worth the splurge every once in awhile."

La quasi absence de trafic routier sur le site en fait un endroit très sécuritaire pour s'adonner à son sport préféré. À cause de son revêtement conçu expressément pour la course automobile, il s'agit de la route la mieux entretenue de Montréal. C'est aussi un bon endroit pour courir si l'on préfère les longs parcours plats. À vélo, l'endroit est accessible par la piste cyclable du pont de la Concorde via le vieux Montréal. Pour le roller-blade ou la course à pied, je vous suggère d'utiliser le métro ou le pont Jacques Cartier. \nBien sûr, la semaine du grand-prix, le circuit fait place aux amateurs de F1. Il devient donc inaccessible aux cyclistes et autres promeneurs. L'endroit devient bondé de touristes internationaux attirés par l'atmosphère glamour du grand cirque de la F1. À ce moment, les prix de la restauration sur l'île frôlent le ridicule. Je conseil aux amateurs de course d'apporter un gouter, ce qui vous fera économiser beaucoup. Malgré cela, l'Île Notre-Dame reste la destination F1 la plus abordable au monde !\nEn conclusion, le CGV est à découvrir, surtout lorsque la F1 n'est pas de passage à Montréal.

This was problematic for me as the food tasted so good that I didn't want to stop eating despite starting to make myself feel sick from being overfull. The Big Bear also comes with tea/coffee AND juice which is generous but way too much for me which leads to feelings of guilt that I can't finish my juice. \nI've also had the waffles here which are also a popular choice. It's disappointing that they don't have pancakes on the menu (or not that I've seen) as I'm much more partial to a pancake than a waffle. They are however very flexible in changing things on the menu. The last time I came here for food I had brought my eight year old (and very fussy eater) niece with me. She wanted waffles, but not a full portion, maple syrup and bananas please. Our waiter was kind enough to charge us a half portion of waffles and sort out the bananas for us. (They weren't on the menu at all.) Having a server who understands the pickiness of kids is amazing and makes a trip out with a little 'un less anxiety inducing as you worry what you can get them to eat. \nThe staff here are amazingly friendly and welcoming which makes coming back a real pleasure.

Perusing the reviews I saw someone else mention they call them that as well. Now I dont feel so special. Back then we'd go as this large group and order family style: just picking and choosing from the menu and sharing everything. Based on those experiences I would have given it 5 stars each and every time. From the Shrimp, Artichoke and Cheese Dip and Combination Dip plate for appetizers, to the Gyro Salad, Eggplant Parmesan, Penne Pesto Pasta and of course a side of Crack Fries all washed down with their Passion Fruit Iced Tea, it was essentially my favorite lunch spot for a number of years, and basically my introduction to Mediterranean cuisine that had previously been limited to gyro sandwiches at carnivals or mall food courts. \nFast forward some years and a new job that's much further, along with a lot more experience with Mediterranean food than I had before, and a little bit of the luster has worn off. I've been back sporadically dining in much smaller groups and as a couple and have had a mix of good and bad. The gyro salad is still always a good choice, and I do still enjoy their pita gyros even though I've certainly had better. I still love their Combination Dip platter, and if you like hummus you're doing a disservice to yourself in not trying the Hummus with Pesto dip here. I've had the pita bread and crack fries range from hot and delicious to coming out cold and hardened. I'm also not a huge fan of their falafel and rank it among some of the worst I've had here in Las Vegas. The Passion Fruit iced tea remains delicious which is comforting.\nIn the end I still count on Paymon's to deliver a solid meal more often than not, though I do long for the days eating there with an impressionable mind and lots of food to try. Now I'm getting all misty-eyed."

Basically we negotiated a verbal deal on a Friday, I had to goto the bank and would be back Monday to purchase. He said he could not hold the car, which I understood. When I returned Monday he almost refused to sell me the car at the price we talked about because he said he would not go that low. Even the sales person I was talking to said we agreed on the price. After finally agreeing and making me feel very unappreciated and talked about to other employees while signing papers we left with the car.\nThe Toyota service and Volkswagen service have both been great overall, even though toyota always tries to upsell you random things while you wait for an oil change, but the wait room is nice, free shuttle, car wash, etc makes it a good deal."

I tried one cupcake (Chocolate Wasted) from this place before and enjoyed it. However second time around trying these, weren't so good. The presentation of these cupcakes are really good, however when you take a bite, it's another story. \nReview on the cupcakes we had:\nChocolate Wasted: The overall cupcake was delicious. From the frosting to the actual cupcake. And it was moist like a cupcake SHOULD be.\nRussian Climax: Taste of the cupcake was okay, but it was falling apart as I ate it from being so dry.\nRed Dragon Cupcake: I couldn't enjoy anything about this cupcake except the frosting. I thought the Russian Climax was dry, but this was horrible! It was almost like eating a scone. \nI'm not sure why the cupcakes turned out dry. I really wanted to love these new flavors I was trying, but I couldn't enjoy the cupcake. As a local trying to recommend this from a guests, I'm really embarrassed. This place has so many good reviews, but unfortunately I can't agree with all of them. The only other positive experience was that my sister-in-law requested the cupcakes for 6pm delivery and they came 10 am. A lot earlier than expected, but at least they weren't late."

    "text": "The first time we went here, we ate in and had a great meal, and I gave it 4 stars. We were so happy after that first visit that we returned and took along another couple - who may be moving to our fair city - to introduce them to life as locals. Our experience was less than stellar. But I didn't update my review then. On the second visit, I ordered the same salmon dish I had the first time, and it was so bad I had to send it back. The waitress tried to explain that they use frozen salmon, and yada, yada. Its replacement was just ordinary. The other couple were split 50-50 in their opinions of their dishes.\nDuring our first visit we wanted to get more information about take-out, figuring that we'd be doing that on a regular basis. We particularly wanted to know about the soup. Our Tom Kha was fabulous, and it was such a big bowl that we couldn't imagine we'd get that much if we had it as take-out, but the waitress assured us it was a very big container.\nSo on this uncharacteristically rainy night, we opted for take-out from Noodle House. My first disappointment was taking an ordinary Chinese restaurant-type plastic container out of the bag that was only three-quarters full. It turned out not to matter: the soup was so unbearably spicy that we couldn't finish it. It also had half the amount of chicken that our dine-in portion had. \nFour vegetable spring rolls were decent, but very greasy. \nWe ordered our main dish, Pad Thai, as a chicken-beef-shrimp combination. It had a \"generous\" helping of two rather small shrimp, chewy and flavorless beef, and some tender chicken. This dish is usually very bland at other Thai restaurants, but this one was very spicy. I didn't mind that, since it didn't cause smoke to come out of my ears like the soup did. But the noodles were rubbery, and if it had chopped peanuts, there weren't enough to taste them. A disappointment.\nI guess it was too good to be true, but we'll go back to the other Thai restaurants we used to go to before our hopes were raised by the opening of Thai-Style Noodle House, which is so much closer to our home. Those hopes sadly have been dashed."

My last visit to Vegas I ended up only at the bar as I forgot to make reservations so my boyfriend and I just came for mojitos. Yes, just mojitos. And you know what, they're worth the $14 a piece for them.\nSo over the years this place has progressively increased their prices which sucks, but the quality of food has always been top-notch. Plus, it's rare that I have good Tex-Mex cuisine. What I get is always California washed out Mexican food. This is a fantastic change while keeping the integrity of so many familiar ingredients.\nMy favorite appetizers are a tie between the goat cheese queso fondidu and the the blue corn pancake with BBQed duck. Now, many years ago the queso fondidu used to be melted goat cheese with a poblano salsa which I actually preferred over the rajas they serve with it now. That's just my personal preference though, but I still really like it a lot. With the blue corn pancake I've had inconsistencies with the amount of duck, and how they've plated it. Mixed in --- or sliced on top --- I'm assuming maybe it was just the quality of the duck, or from where they got the meat from. Breasts slice nicely, so that goes on top. Thigh not so much, so that get mixed in? Ok. Still good. I love duck in any way, so no complaints on my end taste-wise.\nFrom the most current menu, I'd have to say the pan roasted venison is my favorite and a close second would be the New Mexico spiced pork tenderloi. I've never ordered the 16 spice chicken however I've had it a couple of times over the years from picking off of other people's plates and the chicken has always been consistently good and never dry. \nThere used to be a spiced steak on the menu a long time ago and I wish they'd bring that back. :( The last two times I haven't ordered a steak so I don't know if any of the new steaks even compare. The ribeye looked fantastic, maybe next time I will order that. \nI'm sure next time I'm in Vegas I'll be back again, like I always am, even if it's just for a mojito. I love Mesa Grill."

I'd always heard that Nello's wings are the best ... turns out they're not. They were soggy. Really soggy. The sauce is about as flavorful as you can find anywhere.\nThe pizza, as I recall, was okay, but I honestly can't even remember what kind it was, so it obviously didn't make much of an impression on me. Nothing was actually wrong with the food, and nothing would keep me from going back again, but the blurb next to the 2-stars above says it all: \"Meh. I've experienced better."

    "text": "This is a very cool pool, but i certainly wouldn't call it the best in Vegas. I guess everyone looks for something different in a poolside experience. Admittedly, I'm a pool snob. \nThe chairs here were super uncomfortable. You know, those type that leaves welts on you if your towel slides down... The personal space, like most Vegas pools - even at the most expensive hotels - is limited. Seriously, there's no room to walk. Everyone is just too close for comfort. There were no tables or umbrellas to be found anywhere (besides at their unimpressive cabanas) on the day I went. It was just a tight, uncomfortable situation.\nI liked the two pools set off from the beach, but even on an overly windy weekday in April I had trouble finding a spot. The lazy river is a big plus - very cool! Drink service was good and there was always a waitress coming by. \nAs far as music, I think it was like most of the pools on the strip. They don't mix up the genres very well so if they're on one genre you don't like, wait a few minutes and it'll change. It was really loud where I was sitting and some people might have appreciated that but it wasn't conducive to a fall-asleep-while-tanning type of pool day. I like some background music but it seemed no matter where I was at the beach I was sitting under speakers. \nI guess it's a bit more of a family-friendly pool than some. And there are lots of different areas for a change of scenery. But I wasn't too impressed and I wouldn't staycation here just for the pool."

We decided on the ever-so-famous Little White Wedding Chapel. \nNICKEL AND DIME YOU TO DEATH: They kept charging for everything that was supposed to be included-- Example: We already paid our $200 and something in total, but charged an EXTRA $50 for NOT USING their minister, which is weird since a minister is not required in real life, for anything, ever. \nUNPROFESSIONAL: When it came time to check in naturally they said we owed even more money than that even though I had paid in full. It's interesting because I asked several times for a receipt in the weeks prior so I would NOT have this problem. WHy is it SO hard to email a receipt?! So here I am looking like a cheapskate arguing with an angry, incompetent female who apparently doesn't have shit for math skills and can't get her head out of her ass long enough to explain what the F is going on.\nMONEY HUNGRY: They also said they'd record it in case we want to purchase an over-priced DVD, come to find out they never recorded it and gave our friends the run-around. The staff is ridiculous and rude. The organist who didn't even play for us asked my hubby for a tip because she \"doesn't get paid much.\" It's like this: Kiss my ass old woman, the ceremonies last 10 minutes, meaning you get a TIP every ten minutes. You didn't PLAY the organ for us. Of course my hubby tipped her anyway because he's a sweetheart.\nUN-SKILLED: If you opt for pics don't expect much. The photographer took every pic straight on. Every angle identical, no rule of thirds, no angle from above, below, or different sides... and forget lighting or anything else that makes a picture unique. (Not that I'm a professional. But I'm also not pretending to be a photographer like this dude.) Good thing we're a \"fun\" group and made the most of our photos. :) At least the photographer was a nice guy.\nSO! if you want a bunch of rude, incompetent, no-talent ass clowns you've found your venue.\nOn the plus side it's surrounded by porn shops and passed out hookers. Therefore I raise this review from a one-star to a generous 2-star rating."

However, this time was a way different! \nSo many hilarious stories to tell. The 72 hour slaughter fest was freaking nuts man! 5 buddies and myself ventured off to Las Vegas to celebrate our friends birthday through the whole memorial day weekend. We stayed at the Luxor in a 2 bedroom spot in one of the luxor towers. We got slaughtered on the strip. We got slaughtered at the many casinos. We hollared at women both on and off the strip. I gambled a lot and was so drunk i was asking the blackjack dealer to \"hit me\" while i was on 19 LOL. \nWe took pictures with ladies on the strip and ladies we met in the club. We managed to catch a live performance inside the Cesar's palace club \"pure\" of Method Man and Redman for their new album Release of \"BLACKOUT 2\" i believe. I managed to be the only one not dancing during the performance staring at Meth and Red like a zombie - on one because i was so blasted. In addition, i also managed to get kicked out out the club ( nonviolently ) and somehow ended up in the backstage area of Cesar's palace. Yet, with all of this happening, i somehow caught a $20 dollar limo back to the Luxor by myself. LMAO. \nLuxor's breakfast buffet was great. I really didn't eat much anywhere else. It was a lot of drinking done that whole weekend. I'll be going back soon hopefully. But this time we will be flying and not driving. That drive was brutal lol. \nAs i said, many stories man. Vegas is definitely not a place for a family. There is drugs, drunk people, and working girls in and around the casinos all over the place. LOL. I highly recommend it for adults! It is in fact, an adult playground indeed! LOL \nDefinitely go and get slaughtered and leave all inhibitions aside!! yeaaa!!!!!!! \n5 out of 5 because i was with all my boys!"

The BBQ was infused with more smoky flavor than you would find at most NC BBQ joints. It was not a subtle background taste like it is at Spoon's or Old Hickory House. So, A+ on the BBQ.\nAlso, the staff were all really great. Super friendly and attentive.\nI got the side of brown sugared bacon, which was super tasty, but left me feeling like I had ordered a side of candy, which, really, I guess I had.\nThe pickled onions on top of the 'cue were a brilliant addition, and the hushpuppies were tasty but really too small. They were the size of those mega gumballs you used to get from the nickel machine as a kid.\nNow the down side... Price. $9 for the small plate is just too expensive for what you get.

It was the most moist, buttery, flavorful cupcake I had ever eaten. MARGARITA in a cake? Brills! So today, my husband and I made the 25 minute trek to Fort Mill to try the real deal. \nSome CCz'd diehards...please don't hurt me when I say some flavors were extremely dry, crumbly and impossible to pick up with a fork. We had the cookies and creme cupcake on a recommendation, and the flavor was DY-NO-MITE. It tasted just like an Oreo cookie sundae. The frosting, dead on for the Oreo filling. But the cake...oh dear. \nWe also got the 24 Karat, which is a carrot cake, but with coconut, walnuts and raisins. THIS CAKE IS TO DIE FOR. That moistness was back, and the flavor, bursting with each bite. There is a lot of frosting on this cupcake, but my husband ate the rest of what I didn't eat. \nTIP: They sell cartons of milk and other drinks...very important to the cupcake experience!\nCC #3: Butter Rum Toffee. The frosting is deliciously buttery and sweet, but again, the cake, was...not as dry as the cookies and cream, but it tasted as if the cake had been sitting out all day. We went at about 2:30pm, and it was the 2nd to last BRT cupcake in the case, so maybe it just fell victim to being out in the open too long? \nCC#4: Vanilla on Vanilla. Same as BRT. Clear vanilla taste in the cake and frosting, but slightly dry. Have had better. \nCC#5: Double Chocolate: Dense and super chocolaty-- this was moist and brownie-like, but still doesn't beat the 24 Karat! \nBottom Line: The setting is friendly and homey, with bright colored wooden tables and wooden chairs with wicker seats. Lots of kids around, lots of options. I'd get the cupcakes fresh as soon as they come out of the kitchen, or know which flavors are known for being moist. \nWhen you get a good one, Cupcrazed knocks it outta the park.\nTIP: Mini cupcakes (in egg cartons) are $15 a dozen (When we were there today, it was bacon maple, mmm.) and there was one lone giant cupcake, which was $5. \nOne day I will have to try a \"push pop\"-- which I'm told is like the old-school kids push pops (think, Flintstones sherbet!) but with cake and frosting layers in a clear tube!"

    "text": "As many others have noted, I have seen a number of changes with the switch to the new chef. In general I have liked it though one time I did order a side of soup and it was $8 (I'm cheap and that seemed somewhat pricey for an item at lunch). However, I have been meaning to check out the brunch and this Sunday, the day of the Superbowl, I made my move. \nWalked over to Mill and picked up a New York Times at Starbucks (because it isn't Sunday morning without the New York Times - not being elitist, it is just a great way to spend two or three hours on a lazy Sunday). Showed up at 9:45 (I though the yelp time said they opened at 8 am but who knows). Asked if I could just sit at the bar till the opened and read the paper and Eric, the bartender, had no problem with it. Eric turned out to be a nice guy and along with breakfast I had some great conversation (we both agreed Samsung makes a hell of a flat screen TV). \nI was planning to have coffee but since it was Superbowl Sunday I thought, what the hey and ordered a White Sangria. Eric drew mine out of a huge jar full of Sangria with all sorts of fresh fruit, into a large wine glass and finished it off with extra ice. Wow, it was great Sangria. He mentioned they not only put in white wine but add brandy and I think peach Schnapps to the mix and believe me when I tell you, one is plenty. I have a pretty high tolerance and even I had a nice comfortable alcohol buzz by the time I finished it. \nAs for the food, oh the food! I had the eggs Benedict which comes with basil hollandaise (had to look up how to spell that one) sauce. It was truly to die for. The bread was somewhat crusty and stood up well to the sauce, the hollindaise was perfect, a melange of butter with a hint of lemon, the ham was more like prosciutto and created a gentle bed of salty ham goodness on which was nestled a perfectly poached egg. The best eggs I ever had were in Japan and have not had ones that tasted as good until today. The salty flavor (and it was not too salty, but you could taste it) was balanced out with the sweeter flavor of the Sangria. \nThe bartender was nice enough to ask if I wanted an espresso or coffee, or another Sangria, and he provided me with water and kept it filled, without asking (I'm a sucker for good service). \nCost of the eggs Benedict is $14 and if you want one (and if you are not a big eater one is fine) is $8. Next time I have it I would probably have the smaller portion and combine it with the side dish of fruit ($8) for a bit of a healthier breakfast. The Sangria, just know that if you come with a friend get a pitcher because by the pitcher, not by the glass, it is half off. \nSo, go for breakfast and instead of the bottomless Bellini thing, get the Sangria, and yes, go for breakfast! It is a lovely time of the year and a perfect time to sit on the patio and guess what, you can ride the light rail to it, what more could you ask for on a lazy Sunday morning! :-)"

    "text": "When you're at the August Wilson Center for a 7 pm show, and you have a blind lady in tow, your choices for dinner within walking distance are extremely limited in this block of downtown. So after trying to view options up and down the block without walking in circles, we opted to give Tonic a try since it was directly on the opposite corner from August Wilson Center.\nWe walked in, and were greeted by a friendly staff member, and given a seat. The atmosphere was rather pleasant, or at least the decor. It was clean, the staff was friendly, the seats were fine. The background music and conversation (downstairs) were not obnoxious or overpowering. The two giant screen TVs with incessant sports coverage were obnoxious, but they always are, and seem to be ALWAYS present in da burgh. But even with the sound turned off, I swear I could feel them trying to leech out as much of my IQ as they could.\nWe perused the menu, which seemed to be VERY basic, with appetizers, sandwiches, soups, salads, and very few 'meal' options, and the prices were a tad outrageous for such 'basic' options.\nWe ordered our sodas (thanks goodness, Coke product people), and I ordered a burger, and my friend the fish and chips. \nThe service staff was very friendly, including the trendy new boy in training who did a little boogie dance in the dining room...he was in a GOOD mood. The gal that was training him was a little more subdued, but I gathered that it was one of her last days before moving on to another job. Together, they provided excellent service. And the new boy was kind of adorable in his way.\nThen came the food. The 'Gourmet' burger boasted of being 8 oz of Kobe beef, with mushrooms and cheese, bacon and caramelized onions, and came with a side of fries. I opted to leave off the onions, and ordered the burger medium rare. The fish and chips was two big blobs of fried fish, a mound of fries, and a small bowl of cole slaw.\nThe burger was NOT fresh. The difference between fresh meat and frozen meat can be clearly seen with asking for it with any level of 'rare'. Fresh meat in a state of rare comes pink, frozen comes grey no matter HOW you ask for it, and this burger was grey. The bun was a little dried out, and the burger itself had very little flavor except for the over-abundance of artificial garlic or liquid smoke they used to season it. It was the kind of fake seasoning that created the cloud of garlic stench that surrounded me and fellow adjacent theater attendees for three hours of play, and several hours of a gassy stomach. The fries were fine, though clearly out of a bag of frozen processed and seasoned fries. And the burger didn't come with lettuce or tomato. This was $11.50.\nThe fish and chips were also of the freezer bag variety. My friend ate one lump of fish, and gave the other to me, which gave me soggy greasy breading, and a rubbery and flavorless fish. She had a bigger mound of fries than me, but they were the same freezer bag fries, and the slaw just looked kind of vinegar based. This was $15.\nNow, when you can get the best burger in town at Winghart's in Market Square which is real fresh ground beef, made truly to order, with actual flavor, for $7.50, why would you even try to go all 'bistroid' with a fakey and substandard frozen burger for $11.50? And this was the least expensive burger on their list!\nSame goes for the fish and chips. If you're going to pretend to be all uppity, then by gosh, make it fresh from scratch if you're going to charge a gourmet price for it.\nOne thing that I'm really starting to notice in the process of writing these reviews is that it truly seems that the higher the price goes in da burgh, the more mediocre it becomes, and as I've stated in multiple reviews, I don't give two hoots about your 'atmosphere'. I'm going for the food. And if the food is overpriced and substandard, I'm gone.\nThis was definitely a FTLT (first time, last time) visit."

Wait staff was accommodating and friendly.\nI had the chicken lettuce wraps. My girlfriend had the asian pork bbq appetizer. Both were pretty good. The beer is good and they do have quite the collection from which to choose.\nWe like to go there roughly once a month and that won't change after our latest visit. Definitely a pleasant atmosphere and good place to get some food whether it's early or late.\n4 stars!"

I went down to the concierge who informed me he didn't think they still offered happy hour but I could go up and check. Sure enough happy hour was a go! You can only order the cheap food at the bar bar- not the sushi bar. It's really a steal! I have 3 kinds of sushi and a water and left feeling full, happy, fancy and only spending about 20 bucks. \nThe bartender was friendly enough and the sushi was fresh and tasty. The happy hour is a great deal!"

The restaurant is located across from PNC Park in just about the least artsy-fartsy neighborhood of Pittsburgh. But I guess Post-Game Drunken Fratboy Hangout doesn't really have a good ring to it.\nIs it a nod to Pittsburgh's very own SoHo? Lord, I hope not. The restaurant has far more glam than the rundown neighborhood trapped between Duquesne University and South Oakland. But I guess Depressing Shithole doesn't have a good ring to it, either.\nWhatever the story behind its namesake is a moot point upon experiencing the restaurant's fare. Here's what you can expect:\n1. Meh food. The SoHo steak and cheese is essentially chopped steak and Cheez Whiz on a bun. It's not particularly delicious. The fries were good, though.\n2. Outstanding drinks. Perfectly priced, elegantly presented, and expertly mixed. The Cinnamon Toast Crunch martini is ridiculously delicious. Honest to God, it tastes like a friggin' bowl of the cereal. Except with alcohol.\nIf you're in the North Side, go for a cocktail during Happy Hour, but don't schlep out for a special trip or for a memorable meal. You won't find it here."

After she yelled at me for not showing up last week, she then told me that I didn't have an appointment and asked if I could come back. Her employee even told her that I called to make an appointment. Miraculously, it disappeared! After being loyal for so many years, I DO NOT deserve to be treated this way!

It was rough at the beginning but it is so much better with the new management. When first looking into moving here and the first couple of weeks living here it was not good. The management always gave different answers and they never had their stuff together. They had no idea about their property. Now that Alliance is here they are doing a great job. They definitely know what they are doing and they are educated about their property. They are always trying to make the property look nice. They are even re-painting the whole complex to a beautiful new color. I can't wait until it is done! The apartments themselves are beautiful as well. They are multiple floors, ceiling fans in bedrooms, nice appliances, fireplaces, and a beautiful pool and spa. The location couldn't be better either. It is right on the light rail which is so convenient, especially since I am an ASU downtown student. The only negative thing I have to say is parking is an issue. You do get at least a garage or carport. Although if you have multiple cars you have to park in non-covered spots which are limited. If there aren't any spots at night you have to park on the street and move your car by 7am. There is not much that can be though because there is no place to make more parking. Overall this place is beautiful, very safe, and has great new management. I would strongly recommend living here!"

There are 4 small round tables with 2-3 chairs a peice, and 1 larger rectangular table for disabled access with 2-3 chairs also. Prices are normal for a starbucks. Pros: Outdoors in late fall and early spring will be nice here, and it definately can't get crowded here. Cons: Only 2 umbrellas outside keep you shady from the sun or dry from the rain, there doesn't appear to be snacks here. No indoor seating, Midsummer here is going to be bad, also Semi-trucks are constantly shifting on the freeway here so it is very noisy, and there are no power outlets. There are several other open wifi spots here like the days inn and dennys, so you might be better suited to moving to one of those locations, but if you must sit here, then the att&t free wifi hotspot speed is 1.4 Mbit download speed, and 1.2 Mbit upload speed.

When I told one of the workers that my sandwiches were ready and I'm ready to pay, she said the cashier who takes take-out orders is on break and I had to wait in line. There were 3 or 4 people in front of me and and the cashier must've been new because she looked like she didn't know how to take orders. Guess they didn't want my money right then and there. After waiting for about 10 mins, two workers came back from their break and one jumped on the other register. Finally I was able to pay, but the cashier was confused and couldn't find my order. \nI'll mostly likely go back again, but what horrible service.

You also have to order a miso soup or a beverage to get this deal, so it ends up coming out to right under $20 w/ tax, which is still an outrageously great value. **A few of the items require a $2 up charge, but you don't have to order those. \nWe ended up ordering two of the specials, here is what he had:\nMiso Soup - Balanced flavors, a little on the salty side but still quit satisfying.\nJapanese \"Ceviche\" - Chopped sashimi (tuna, salmon, and yellowtail) with some jalapenos, red pepper in a soy/miso based sauce. This dish was tasty and fresh, but not a lot of fish really. \nAgedashi Tofu - Topped with grated Daikon radish in a light soy sauce. Good flavor, but the inside of the tofu was a bit slimy. It didn't seem like they used firm tofu, which could be why it was more gloppy than I've had elsewhere. \nCreamy Rock Shrimp - Small shrimp tossed in a heavy mayo/sriraucha sauce. The shrimp were mushy beneath the heavy sauce. I'd avoid this one, there are better options. \nCreamy Rock Shrimp w/ spicy tuna sushi - Same complaint about the shrimp as above, although this time it was on top of a spicy tuna roll. It was just too much going on, too much mayo, and not enough pronounced flavor.\nCrispy rice w/ spicy tuna - The rice was perfectly crisped to give that crunchy texture, but the tuna itself was lacking a lot of flavor. It wasn't spicy, however the sliver of jalapeno on top helped add a little heat. \nShrimp Tempura roll - Very standard. I liked that the roll wasn't huge, so the pieces were a reasonable size to take down in one gobble. \nI left the meal with a bit of a stomach ache, most likely from the heavy mayo sauce on the shrimp dishes.

As it's the only vegetarian sushi option that I found on the menu, I ordered it hoping for more than the usual carrot, cuc and...? (no avocado to be found and I think it should always be featured in a veggie roll to keep it from being too dry). The whole shebang is just really tasteless. The avo/cuc roll I ordered never arrived, but I know our large table ordered up so much that it's not really a big deal. If I had really wanted it, I would have asked for it.

The wait staff is always friendly, and eager to pour sake down your throat. Don't be fooled by the lack of decoration, it's really not what this place is about. The food more than makes up for it. At least once, get away from all of the teppan yaki places around the strip, and try Geisha.

But I've never really had a problem with it in hearing the group or giving our order. \nMy favorite part honestly is the archway between the restaurant and the gift shop. It is a giant fish tank. No animatronic fish here. Real fish. And it's pretty freaking cool. But the star it might gain from that it immediately loses for the prices. Just like many theme restaurants, they are overcharging you for the food. Of course they have to cover the costs of maintaining that fish tank and all those animatronic animals. So while I kinda get it, it's still too much for a regular dinner. \nTheir gift store is almost another review in itself. Again, a bit overpriced, but they honestly do have some really cute stuff. I've gotten a few small things here as gifts over the years for kids who are in that \"I love animals\" phase of life. Always a hit. \nWhen your aunt and uncle with kids come into town and want to go somewhere different that the kids will like - You'll get big bonus points for bringing them here. Other than that, it has a fairly limited audience. And dear heavens, don't bring anyone who is an OCD cleaner. They may never leave."

I've never heard of this place but there were some people staying here so we came back to grub. Me and my friend walked in and there were a lot of people eating which was a good sign. He told me he used to come out here and eat for super cheap, so I was curious to as HOW cheap is SUPER CHEAP.. we sat at the counter and were instantly greeted, got menus and water. Looked at the little sign they had at the counter and saw a whole bunch of stuff for $2-$6 bucks. I was amazed. We both ordered the burger and he also had biscuits and gravy. Our total bill was around $15 bucks.. haha cheap eats in Vegas FTW..\nHeard rooms are decent.. pretty nice and the hotel and casino itself is pretty spacious."

All they had behind the counter was 5 trays of catering dishes with your dinner waiting behind dish 1, 2, etc. Old meat, no grill in sight to bbq the meat or anything. My beef with this lady began when I asked to sample 1 meat. She then proceeded to laugh, yes full out laugh, like that was the craziest suggestion she has heard in her life. She then went on a short rant about her place is small and they can't do that after I mentioned another place (Texas BBQ House) samples everything. What a witch this lady was and then I stormed out laughing at that strange policy and guessing if she didn't want me to taste it, there was no way she was proud of her food and no way it was or ever would be good. 5 star gets no stars."

Turns out Carl's cakes and the flavor I tried was hazelnut apricot.\nI went to see what they offered at the market street diner in terms of variety. I was please that they have 4 or 5 cakes that you can get individual slices from but also a cooler with ready to go full cakes in a variety of flavors. I ended up getting a hazelnut apricot cake good for about 8 to 10 people for only 16 bucks. What a steal! Where can you get a awesome cake for that price nowadays. \nThey also do cheesecakes which I know will lure me back at some point."

If small motels can have free Internet what's grandview's excuse??it's $10 for 24hrs or $50 for a week. ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?? I pay $50 for an entire month at home. And the internet lounge they do have is dial up! And the computers automatically log you out every 15 minutes. It takes 15 minutes just to load a page. Come on grandview; panera and starbucks are making you look cheap and tacky.\n \n2. Parking is a problem. Not enough spaces for everyone to park. I had to park across the street in a pretty abondoned looking lot. \n3. Evey concierge service is able to get discounted tickets just by you staying at their hotel. At grandview you have to sit through a 90 minute(although I bet it's longer) presentation where they try to get you to buy ANOTHER timeshare. Again tacky and cheap.\nThe staff seems to be friendly and the beds are very comfy but they got to change these pretty easy common sense things before they get a better rating from me."

It is located next to a 7-11, so if you want to pick up a beer on the way back to the Strip, it makes it easy.\nEllis has a morning steak and eggs special with home-style potatoes and 2 slices of toast. A heck of a deal, and the steak is actually really good and the eggs I got were a perfect sunny side up. Not too runny. \nEllis also brews their own beer, I got the IPA every time, plus you get a huge pilsner glass of it for $2.25. They also have a light, a stout, an amber and a hefeweizen. Plus they have To-go cups. Score!\nWe ate here about 4 times, but it was too late for the breakfast special so I got the chicken Phillie hoagie, again, really well made. Lots of flavorful onions and peppers with juicy chicken and I got a $3 side salad with blue cheese, which hit the spot.\nOur service was fantastic every time. We even had the same waitress three times. \nThis place is a solid five star for what it is. Old school Vegas eating with quality food and cheap prices. I usually got the breakfast special and 2 beers, and with tip it ran about $12 every time!\nEach time we went at night, it was a 40 minute wait to get seated, so Ellis also has a pizza place and an awesome hoagie shop, both were very good back up plans!\nLots of laughs on a great trip with cheap, great food and beer!"

You want them to do Princess Chicken with sliced carrots and a side of sauce? You got it! You want your fried noodles with a side of pea shoots and baby won-tons? You got it! Okay, wait... that last one I might be making up, but the first, dude... I get it every time!\nAlls I'm saying is-- these people will do everything to make your order, NAY, your EXPERIENCE something awesome. And that's a restaurant I can get behind!\nThe food is excellent. Rice is the perfect consistency (not too dry, but not wet, either). Their sauces are incredible (try the Princess for a spicy kick, or the Empress for something a little spicy-sweet). Their veg is even good in my book, diced or sliced thin, not overbearing! Everything is just hot, and yummy, and delicious and my favorite, not too hard on the wallet.\nGolden Harbor is located in the old Pickles location (trust me, a Champaign paragon in its day), so it's pretty much central to Champaign, Urbana, AND Savoy. Tell them where you're coming from when you order and they'll make sure the food is separated out in containers that keep things from getting soggy on the way. \nWhether you choose to eat in (now that they have the ventilation under control) or decide to carry-out, Golden Harbor Authentic is one of the best Chinese places you can choose in C-U."

They just remolded everything from the outside in, so the interior/exterior decor is more modernized and cleaned up (which is always a plus). I believe the only major accredited store in the Outlets is Coach, and everything else is more of the secondary brands you hear that aren't top dogs but are still known.

No... but it's a must try for anyone local who is partial to MEAT and SAUSAGE! oo'er :)\nI loved the simple decor and the smell of fresh cut wood the minute you open the door.

Mainland's pho was true to what pho should taste like, and the ingredients were top quality and the establishment is clean and trustworthy- not what I'm used to when eating pho. \nI should mention that my sister hated the soup she ordered at first-some sort of grilled chicken soup that she thought was going to be chicken pho but ended up having charbroiled chicken and corn in it...we sent it back and she got the soup I ordered and was enjoying.\nAll in all-I cant wait to come back and bring my pho connoisseur boyfriend and best friend show them that good pho can be done in a nice restaurant.

I should have paid attention to the sinking feeling I felt when, upon walking in during what SHOULD have been the middle of the lunch rush, I realized that NOBODY else was there. Oddly, though, it took a really long time to get our food. The chips and salsa were just barely okay. My tortilla soup was bland, with not much chicken but plenty of overcooked vegetables. The BF ordered a combination plate with a taco, enchilada, and chile relleno. The taco was nothing special. The coating on the chile relleno was a disgusting mass of soggy crust, cheese, and grease. He pushed on it, and a river of grease streamed out onto his plate. The enchilada was...interesting. The filling consisted of a mix of meat, refried beans, and rice. It was virtually tasteless, except for a funny wang of...wait for it...BREAKFAST SAUSAGE. \"Mexican\" food does not get any more gross than this. I'd go to Taco Bell before revisiting Cancun.\nIn the quest for good Mexican food in the Madison area, there IS a bright side, though: Taqueria Guadalajara is re-opening--TOMORROW."

When I do it's usually to Babbo next door but today I did and I have to say I'm glad I did. The place is upscale casual and you order at the register and they bring you the food. The place is super clean and staff was friendly. I asked the gal who took my order what was popular since its my first visit and I went with her first choice, chimichanga! I got the shredded beef with real guacamole, sour cream, beans & rice. They have a great salsa bar and all the hot sauces were great too. Even the beans were a hit which is a good test if a place is going to be good Mexican. It is definitely Americanized but a nice place to have a quick bite. Sorry Babbo, you have a run for your money when I park in this lot."

I know, it was getting old and a little run down. But it was distinct and I always had a place in my heart for the old Igloo. Rick and I had tickets for tonight's Penguins game, but not the Penguins you're thinking of. Their AHL affiliate, the Wilkes-Barre Penguins were playing the Washington Capital's affiliate, the Hershey Bears. We'd only been to one other AHL game before and that was a Chicago Wolves game a few years ago.\nSo how does the Consol Energy Center stack up? Well, nothing will ever replace the Civic Arena but judging it on its own merits, it's fantastic. Besides being brand spankin' new, the seats here are very comfortable and the sightlines here are outstanding. We had main floor seats--we'd never be able to afford those for an NHL game--and we could see everything quite well. They drew a respectable 13,000 for the game too."

I had a chicken and bacon club which had huge chunks of chicken that was so over cooked it was hard to bite through, and bacon that was so fatty I needed to deconstruct the sandwich to pull out most of the fat/bacon. The herby fries were brilliant, though. Some of my friends ordered salads which were huge, but from what I saw looked mostly like *lots* of lettuce and not a lot else. The flip side is that the food is really reasonably priced.\nI also liked how family friendly it is here - I believe they had a microwave in the corner for mums to be able to heat up food for their kids. I think that's great because kids can be picky and I'm sure it's much easier to just be able to bring your own food than hope the restaurant can prepare something they'll like. \nSo I would definitely come back and drink more mojitos and eat more herby fries, but would view the rest of the menu with caution."

Yay, they got rid of that faded old sign advertising Chang's. Although I'm not particularly fond of their tacky new font, at least it's legible! \nLooks like prices have gone up too!\nGroup A - $2\nGroup B - $2.75\nGroup C - $3.95 \nGroup D - $5.95\nGroup E - $7.95\nFor our hungry party of three, we had five items from Group A, seven items from Group B, and one item from Group C.\nThey included:\n* Shrimp Dumplings\n* Pork Dumplings\n* Beef Ball\n* Tofu Skin Roll\n* Steamed Tripe\n* Beef Rice Noodle Roll\n* Chicken Feet in Black Bean Sauce \n* Deep Fried Ground Pork Dumpling\n* Deep Fried Taro and Ground Pork Dumpling\n* Shanghai Dumplings (Group C) - It's something they don't push around in the carts. You have to put in a special order for it. Our order was had four dumplings, but you can request eight. It came out piping hot - just the way it's supposed to be. Be careful with the soup inside because it burned my tongue! \nThe whole point of going out for dim sum is to \"yum cha\" which means to drink tea. Therefore, tea charges is as follows:\n* Tea is $.50/person\n* Chrysanthemum tea is $1/per person\nI wanted to end our lunch with something sweet and looked over the Egg Custard Tarts. They appeared to be the same ones that were out when we first arrived, so I passed on that. We also skipped on the Egg Custard Pineapple Bun this time around since we didn't see them come out fresh, and these buns needed to be eaten piping hot only! They did offer the dessert tofu dish, but that's not my favorite. Perhaps they need a better sweet selection or at least a higher turnover on it so things can still come out fresh! \nThe service was surprisingly attentive on a Monday and there was no wait. Our water glasses and tea pot were constantly refilled without us asking, which we really appreciated. A large bus group did arrive shortly after us and did take up some of the attention, but it was understandable.\nUnfortunately, they do not have hot chili oil anymore, just the regular hot chili sauce. I'll continue to ask for it in case they bring it back!\n3.5 stars"

    "text": "I recently visited Claddagh Irish Pub in Middleton's Greenway Station for a happy hour-munchies thing after work with a pal. We had beer, shared an order of the corned beef and cabbage rolls, and split a \"Paddy Mac\" sandwich, which is essentially a Reuben. The food was quite good. I especially enjoyed the corned beef and cabbage rolls, which when I went, were similar to a fried wonton that had the fixings of St. Patrick's Day dinner inside. Sort of like an Irish egg roll. Yum. The Reuben was average, but the fries were pretty tasty as well. Service was unremarkable in either a good or a bad way. All said and done, I would usually rank that sort of experience as four stars. Normally, I would definitely return to a restaurant that showed me a good time and had good food. \nWhy then, you ask, is this a one star review? Let me explain.\nI take major (MAJOR) issue with Claddagh's use of the words \"gluten friendly\" to describe certain menu items. (Menu items that are often served with bread.) I presume this was done in an effort to appeal to the now-popular dietary trend of avoiding gluten. The problem with this, Claddagh, is that \"gluten friendly\" is not a thing. If someone can't eat gluten, then they can't eat gluten. Period. Full stop. \nCladdagh's use of the term \"gluten friendly\" to describe foods that still contain gluten, would be like if JIF Peanut Butter made a new type of peanut butter that was 50% peanuts and 50% almonds...and then tried to market the new product as \"Peanut Allergy Friendly\". Does that make sense?\n Although I personally find vague claims of \"gluten intolerance\" dubious, especially when the person has never had a problem eating gluten before, there are definitely people with a **medical diagnosis** of Celiac's disease who absolutely, under no circumstances, can consume gluten. I feel that Claddagh's attempt at marketing its menu to appeal to the \"gluten-free\" dietary trend could harm people who actually need to avoid gluten for important medical reasons. Even if it's not a life or death situation, people who wish to avoid gluten should be allowed to do so without having to jump through hoops and worry about being tricked by menus. \nIt's majorly unethical to twist words to imply that a thing is something that it's not. This is especially true when the item in question (food) has the potential to directly impact a person's health. \nCladdagh: fix your menu. If you want to offer gluten-free options, then please do so. However, referring to a spinach-artichoke dip appetizer served with crostini or to a hamburger served on a wheat bun , or even to your fish fry, which is battered in flour as \"gluten friendly\", is unethical. People have a right to know what's in their food, and this feels like a deliberate attempt to mislead people in the name of making more money."

Not to mention a spot to get lined up while getting tatted up. The tattoo parlor was still undergoing construction as of 1.13.12. Meanwhile the other half of Distrct holds 2 completed dance studios. They also carry a small selection of premium kicks and apparel supplied by local designers. Hopefully they will be carry writing supplies as well much like Pop 2 provides up by the Arts District.\nIts under my impression that members of the renowned b-boy crews Full Force and Jabbawockeez opened up shop for the preservation of hip hop and understanding the importance for the hip hop community to finally have a place to unite and build without having to deal with all the hassle and red tape of other venues such as those on the strip. They presently host classes ranging from the beginner to advanced b-boy, being led by no other than Red BC One Veteran/Champ Ronnie, Jabbawockeez member Rainen, B-Girl classes by Crykit, DJ classes and more. But I can already envision all out hip hop jams, additional hip hop workshops, more food truck mash-ups and much more. Middle school Warren with shelltoes and windbreakers is all fu*king giddy with delight and can hardly contain the excitement bubbing up from within..\nPeople, outside of Tunay Studios you'd be hard pressed to find another spot like this being led by the caliber of instructors that they have here. If you have any desire whatsoever to quit that abysmal 9 to 5 office job and become a full time b-boy or b-girl this is pretty much it. \nWith the Distrct providing an sufficient anchor, I'd keep a close eye on this little rundown strip mall. With recent rise of the Arts District and Fremont East I wouldn't be surprised if something magical becomes of this written off, tucked away part of town -- much like the two aforementioned areas once were.\nAs an added bonus: the Pinball Hall of Fame is right across the street. \nOnce again, in your face multi-gazzilion dollar casinos."

I rarely waited in a line more than two people deep, which can maybe be attributed to people (rightfully) thinking that standing in the sun and eating lots of food would be pretty uncomfy.\nI knew it'd be tough as a vegetarian here, and it was just as I expected. Spinach dips galore (2 tents), a roasted red pepper sammich (aaarrgh), and gazpacho (3 tents!) were the options, as well as various stuffs from good ol' Woodlands and Namaste. The standout for me was the Spinach dip from Village Tavern - cheddar, jalapenos, multicolor corn chips, it was good enough to maybe drag me to the brick and mortar. We'll see.\nI kept feeling overwhelmed by corporate presence. Every time I turned around, I felt the eerie stare of Dunkin Donuts, or Jamba Juice, or freekin' Land o Lakes (just thinking about cream on this hottest of days was enough to make me sweat), just booth after booth of two story mobile \"Flavor Factories\" and other creepy, rhymie stations. Weird, and not what I expected.\nThose neat fans with the misting component were pretty sweet, and the beer stations were frequent and comfy. But if your only experience with local eats in CLT was from this 5 block corpo-business party, you'd be underwhelmed, to say it nicely. Where was a Vietnamese outpost? A pal tried (all of) the BBQ available - not impressed. Little-to-no classic Southern (hey, Mert's was here, at least). And nary a local beer to be seen.

We ordered two glasses of wine and were given the cheap white italian bread with butter and garlic salt. Is it good, sure, I guess, but it's just hwo I described it. Cheap bread to fill up on. Started with Crab Cakes - awful, crumbly, dry, mostly breading, corn, etc, should be called a crab flavored bread fritter. And even then it would be subpar. We also had the calamari fritti - it was fair - nothing more. We upgraded to caesar salads with our entries. The caesar salad is just chopped up romaine in bite size pieces and enormous croutons of the same cheap white bread, swimming in creamy, mayonnaisey bottle dressing. Do they even know what a real ceasar is or at least what the dressing should be like? I understand that a salad that comes with an entry usually isn't anything special, but you'd like something that actually taste a little like a caesar. WTH? There's a lot of lag between courses and the atmosphere is \"mature.\" Main courses came - I had Tortellini that should've had some proscuitto in it, but I certainly couldn't find any. It had plenty of mushroom pieces and peas and was basically fine if what you wanted was Stouffer's Tortellini. It had no depth, milky sauce, just blah. But the worst or all, was my husband's Cioppino. Two shrimps on top were molten hot, the slab of cod was stiff and cold, the clams were cold and sooo firm you could hardly pull them out of the shell. It was a mess. We can't even figure out how this dish was put together because of the varying temps??? There was a mound of pasta under the sauce, but hubby was hesitant to eat any for fear of getting sick from the weirdly cooked seafood. At this point, we felt like we'd been there forever. We ordered a Tiramisu to go, hoping it'd be decent and we'd have something we could eat for all our time and money and paid our bill. We just wanted out of that dull, hideous place. When we got home, we sampled the Tiramisu - again, totally inauthentic and blah, blah, blah. The lady fingers should be drenched/soaked, not dry and stiff - this was basically stiff lady fingers with heaps and heaps and heaps of sweet marscapone with liberal cocoa powder on top. Apparently, if you want a LOT of food, but don't care if it taste anything like Italian food, you'll like this place. We're from Chicago and have eaten in some high end Italian places, good ol' family style Italian restaurants and some that had the classic americanized things like Tortellini, etc and this was like nothing I've ever experienced. Bland, tasteless, cafeteria food. You could probably get better frozen items at Costco. Ugh!"

For instance, the 16'' is dry, ultra thin, and not very filling. If you are a fan of Papa John's, I'm pretty sure that you'll agree.\nThere are plenty of discounts too. I bought a certificate through my work where I pay $5 and get $15, but have to spend at least $22. So, after the math, $12 for $22 worth of food (excluding the pizzas) isn't bad (except for the first time I tried to use the coupon and they wouldn't let me use it because it was a Football Sunday even though it stated nothing to that affect on the certificate). You can also get 20% off with your AMC movie ticket. They also have some decent specials, but I can recall them... so, I'll update this review a bit in the future."

The service was impeccable and the food was brilliant.\nThe restaurant is rather elusive. It is hidden between two cheap electronic stores and there is no sign on the door. I had to walk twice in front of it to actually find the door. Once inside, it was actually rather entertaining to see other people do the same.\nThe wine selection is rather large and they offer a lot of wines by the glass. However, I asked for something non-alcoholic: an iced tea. I was sitting at the bar and the bar tender told me: \"we don't have iced tea. I can make you one if you want but it will take five minutes.\" Awesome. That Iced tea was very carefully crafted with a but of sweetness perfectly balanced by a little lemon. I loved it. And I love that he just made it on the spot.\nAs a starter, I ordered a special: some crab salad on a perfectly toasted bread with radish, avocado purée and charred avocado. Right after the first bite, I was absolutely amazed. It was so fresh, flavorful and balanced. Then, I had scallops with charred zucchini, shiitake, pear and watercress. So much pleasure into every bite.\nThen, I asked if, by any chance, the bartender would be willing to make me another iced tea. Not only he was willing, but he had thought about it ahead of me: I thought you might want a second one so I had prepared a little more. That's what an impeccable service is.\nFinally, for desert, I had a \"baba aux fraises\". It was great but could have been better. The strawberries could have been sweeter. it was still delicious though."

Bowling is always entertainment and if you throw in disco bowl? Well then you've got yourself a party! On the weekends, they put large video screens in the middle of the alley and play music videos while you bowl. The music video selection are classic pop and rap and perfect to make the mood upbeat and fun. \nWhen it comes to pricing, it's pretty on par with other bowling alleys. When we go on the weekends, it's $14 for two hours of bowling which also includes shoes, so depending on how fast you bowl, you could get several games in the two hour time period. If you're bringing a large group, I suggest calling ahead and reserving a lane."

Like accurate pregnancy tests! Why pay an insane amount of money for something that you are going to pee on and then throw away? Yeah, I said it. Yeah, I've bought a few. Don't worry ladies, I'm your guinea pig.\nThis store has name brands, such as Dove soap, Colgate tooth paste, Lysol cleaning supplies, and the list goes on. They are smaller than what you would find at a \"normal\" store though. \nAs for their produce, I have only bought a watermelon here, but it was tasty. I took it to a party and everyone loved it. I know some snooty people, so I kept it to myself until after they ate it.\nThey have cute kitchen gadgets, like melon ballers and garlic crushers.\nBelieve it or not, I can find things here that I am not able to find anywhere else (at least for a decent price.) Today, it was Popsicle (aka craft) sticks. I looked at two stores with no luck, and I was able to pick up a hefty amount of them for .99 cents!\nAnd of course, CARDS. Why pay almost $3 ( and up! ) for a card that says \"Happy Birthday\", when you know that they are most likely going to pluck out the $20 bill that was inside and toss the card. \nThe things that sucks.\nIt a usually hood rat central. Mom's screaming at their kids, telling them that they're going to beat their @SS and take their bracelets away.\nChecking out is terrible. Sometimes they only have one register open, and the line can curve around the store. \nIt is worth a try!"

I have given dozens so many chances since then, tried different locations but they just dont make a good cupcake anymore. This review is referring to my last experience. The one that broke the camels back. I recently went to the Butler location and ordered 2 cupcakes, Vanilla and Chocolate (simple). The customer sevice was great. the girl was friendly and nice. (2 star worthy) The cupcake however was meh. The cake was really dry. I mean it was later in the day (5pm) when i got them but still a delicious well made cupcake should remain moist for at least a day. The icing was also crusty too sweet and not creamy. The cupcakes did not taste fresh. I hear they do lunch/brunch items now. I spotted someone having some mac and cheese, so maybe their focus has moved from their baked goods to lunch items..who knows? There are places in pittsburgh that make better cupcakes so why bother? I won't be going back to Dozens. We're done! Kaput!"

Its a good location, little or no crime, the apartments are nice, the pool is great. \nHowever, Brenda the Home Owners Association lady that works in the office is quite possibly the devil herself. She spends so much time telling tenants \"no\" and being hostile that it always feels like you are being watched or are in trouble. \nThree Examples: \n1. I have been living there for 2 years, I know everyone in the front office by name, they know me by name and unit number. I had a package at the front office and one of the gals went to get my package Brenda would not allow her to give it to me until the gal checked my ID.\n \n2. I rented the club house to throw a party for some friends, it was a clothing swap where we donated donated our clothes to charity. Brenda withheld my deposit until I came back to the club house to push all the chairs in straight. Mind you, the rest of the place looked better when we left than before we came in.\n3. We are regularly by the pool on the weekends and a big group of tenants all hang out and enjoy the facilities. Brenda put up signs and lectured everyone that we were not allowed to have any beverages, including water, within the pool area. We were told we needed to eat and drink over by the grills. \nWe are good tenants. We aren't party animals, we aren't prudes. We are a young couple who is respectful, clean and friendly. We get along very well with many of the other tenants. I am not one to complain about silly little issues. I get annoyed with the overly dramatic reviews that people leave for certain establishments. I would honestly say that this location is wonderful, we really like the apartments. But unless you are willing and prepared to deal with a nazi HOA lady, don't bother."

We really went for the view and it is worth 45 minutes of your time. It is best to go before 10pm to avoid the cover charge. Also, they had a line waiting to get in when we left...even though it was not crowded inside.

However, the people behind her I believe to be hair stylist were chatting rather loudly about personal issues and eating at their stations. My appointment was at 1pm for a massage with Christine. I receive a voice mail the day before to confirm my 1pm appointment - (I still have the voice mail), I arrived little before 1pm, I filled out paper work and waited half an hour for my appointment. At 1:30 Christine finally came out to get me. She asked what kind of massage I wanted and what my problem area was. Told her I bought and wanted deep tissue, my neck and shoulders were problem areas. She immediately told me that with a deep tissue massage \"something will be left out\"-I was surprised by her comment because I've never been told this before. I asked her to get my entire body. Unfortunately, she spent ALL her time on my neck and shoulders, she did a great job, but I did not get the massage experience I went there for. As the massage hour came to an end she said I had a few minutes left-so do I want a scalp or feet massage? I chose feet . I was extremely disappointed with the massage, she didn't get my legs or scalp no one apologized for making me wait no one even acknowledged it. I will never return or recommend this spa. Worst spa experience ever, too bad since its so close to home. I decided to finally write this review because I emailed Cloud 9 to give them an opportunity to at least speak to me about my experience, but after almost two month it is obvious the owners JUST DON'T CARE!!!!"

Come later, as the place gets really busy in prime time and you'll get better, faster quality service when there are fewer customers there. They're open until 3am, so there's time to get hungry so you can indulge. Highly recommend ordering half rolls so you can enjoy different varieties. \nThe place is very big and located in the original area of Chinatown before it expanded several city blocks; plenty of parking too as it shares a large parking area with the shopping center. Besides sitting at the bar, there's plenty of tables. The waitress came around quite often to make sure they get in all your orders, or you can sit at the bar and directly tell the sushi chef what rolls you want. Interestingly, they do serve sashimi, but it's one of the ones that you're only limited to 3 pieces. If sushi isn't your thing, they have quite a bit of non-sushi items such as galbi, okonomiyaki, noodles, fried rice, kalbi, dynamite, gyoza, calamari, and skewers to name a few though some you're limited to ordering one per customer. \nAs for sushi and roll choices, there's quite a lot of variety and they don't skimp on having originals. Besides standard sushi rolls, there's a full page of specialty rolls and signature rolls, which I had thought was the same thing but I guess I'm wrong. I ordered the Something Wrong (soft shell crab with shrimp with salmon, tuna, and dakon on outside), WTH Roll (soft shell crab and cucumber with tuna, spicy crab and jalapeno on outside), and Rock & Roll (tuna, salmon, yellowtail, avacado with cucumber wrap). They were all covered in sauce but were really good, especially considering it was an AYCE place. I also ordered a couple of gizzards, galbi, miso soup, sashimi, salmon sushi, and urchin. I didn't have room for dessert but they have various ice cream including tempura ice cream and something called banana dream. \nThe price is $25.95 per person (for 60 min), drinks are extra. Definitely worth going to especially if the other AYCE places have a long wait!"

Had the usual thai fare on there but there was one dish on there I had to try that I had never recognized before: CATFISH DELIGHT. And my first bite into this dish, I was truly delighted. (ENOUGH WITH THE DELIGHTS) Imagine morsels of catfish fillets fried and covered with a red curry paste accented with basil. The fillets didn't lose it's crunch.. A bit of it was taken away from the paste but there was the ever so slight crunch that made this dish perfect for me!!\nThe curry was typical to other thai curries I had but the Pad See Ew was bomb-tastic. We ordered extra egg on it, such a wise decision friends. They cooked the egg in water (like in egg drop soup) and sprinkled it on top of the perfectly cooked rice noodles. SO ONO! \nI heard they have amazing lunch specials. So try those for me folks, and let me know how it goes. If it's anything like my dinner experience, then the lunch specials will be top notch!"

I'm glad she chose to have the gravy served on the side since neither of us cared for it. It was a little too sweet for our taste we skipped it altogether. The hashed browns were great and the eggs were cooked well. I enjoyed the grilled cheese quite a bit. I had hoped for more crunch or char on the bread, but overall the tastes were all very complementary. A little more crunch to the bread would definitely have take this dish to the next level for me. \nService was great and the vibe was just right. I didn't love the parking situation, but since most people who dine here likely work in the area and walk here, I don't see that being an issue for most."

I get the feeling that Grouponers are a nuisance and the red-headed stepchild of full-price paying patrons. \nThe Groupon is for a \"full tasting\", but as we observed others' dishes, the two of us were basically served half servings, equalling a single meal between the two of us. \nHere's another observation. They serve you what \"they\" want. You're given a list of eligible items and are asked to cross off what you have no interest in. You should make sure that the only items not crossed off are the ones you want to be served, because you may leave the Veal and Prime Strip on your list, but they don't bring you that...instead you get a tiny piece of squid or chicken.\nBTW, the valet closes at 9:00.

Still, it took a long time to get our food. \nWe shared the summer rolls, which I think were below average. The wrappers were a bit mushy and I found the rolls to lack flavor. We also got some fried rolls (can't remember the name, but they had yucca root in them... Imperial Rolls maybe?) and they were pretty tasty. \nI ordered the Spicy Lemongrass Tofu lunch special. The salad was average \"bag\" salad, but I liked the dressing - flavorful with a kick. The tofu was yummy - in a curry coconut milk sauce - but it was ONLY tofu. I actually love tofu, but I was hoping for a few veggies. I would not order this again w/o requesting they add some broccoli or something. Just too rich of a dish for my taste. My brother got the kung pao chicken which looked Delicious. My husband had pad thai, which was pretty good. \nThis place was definitely expensive.

Not sure if that means anything to anyone but hey, I'm a fountain of useless trivia!\nIf you're a Packers fan, which I must clearly state that I am not, this is your place. At least for game watching. Lot's of Packers paraphernalia adorning the walls and such.\nWe stopped by here for a pre-dinner drink before heading to Nora's a few doors down.\nLet's see, a 16 oz draft of cold PBR for $2.50 poured by a very nice bartender ...yeah that's my style. Not much for tap selection though, it's your basic American pilsners plus Newcastle brown.\nDid not eat here so no review on the food. They do have a pretty decent sized dining area although I didn't see anyone in there at the time. \nIt's not the crazy Bullys from the heyday, but not a bad place to grab a cold one either."

However, I've been coming to this place for around 2 years and for the deal you can't beat it. \nYes, there was one time I saw a homeless guy living in a one man shanty town that he cobbled under the wash that runs between #10 and #18. Yes, I did see a man on Nellis (drinking a 4Loko at 3 pm in broad daylight on the street) get into a screaming argument with a golfer between a chain link fence for apparently no reason. Yes, sometimes you do have to play winter rules after your ball snuggles up next to a crumpled Natural Ice tall boy on the side of the fairway. And yes, a stray pitbull did pick up my golfing buddy's ball in it's mouth and run for about 50 yards back towards the tee after a drive. All of this is true. I think that's part of the reason I keep coming back.\n I've played some pretty nice courses, but this one has charm. However, for locals after twilight - $15 for 18 holes and a cart can't be beaten. Desert Rose has a pretty nice practice area with full chipping and putting greens, a sand trap and very cheap range balls with grass practice tees. They even have a pretty good deal on 6 Michelob Ultra's and you get a cooler. The staff has always been very nice every time I've been there. \nIf people want to complain, this course is what it is: a great deal. If you don't want to complain go to Rio Secco and pay $200 a round."

Our room got broken into, our stuff got stolen, they refused to take care of us, treated us poorly, did an inspection, even though the lock had been tampered with they still said that they weren't responsible for any of the situation, and treated us like trash. The acquarium pool was barely open. I was there for a week and never got to use it. The staff was rude and short tempered, I lost $2000 worth of items in the robbery (laptop, ipod, etc...), and several of my friends lost more. According to them, they have no security cameras in the hotel, and couldn't even help us find out when we were robbed.\nThe policy and services at the golden nugget are garbage, they are a horrible business, and I would personally turn anyone and everyone I could ever get to listen to me away from going there.\nOn the plus, their black jack tables were very nice, and the casino staff was friendly. The drinks were watered down, but I wouldn't ever complain about drinks at the cost of tips.\nThe rest of freemont was a lot of fun, and other than my experience and vacation being drastically harmed by the horrible HORRIBLE choice to stay at the golden nugget, vegas was a fun place to visit."

The menu is standard for fast hole in the wall Mexican. This may not come as a surprise to my readers but I opt for the chili rellno burrito. I really like their take on it. It consists of the obligatory chili rellno but it is surrounded by guacamole and a tortilla, simple rich and oh so good.\nAs I stated before the draw of this location is the free chips at the salsa bar. The chips the usual well ground corn chips slightly warmed, but the free party really adds to the meal, on average I think I can add over 1000 calories for free to my lunch. \nAdding to the self serve fun this is one of the few locations with a soda fountain that you can access for free refills."

The processes result in a sustainable advantage in the marketplace. \nVRIO Framework\nValue: Neutralizes external threats with unique mandatory 10 day meat curing time and high inventory turnover. Smoked meat sandwiches are served by fat content: lean, medium and fat. The theory of YOLO (You Only Live Once) suggests fat. As well, the theory of YOLO also suggests a cheesy smoked meat poutine, the ingestion of your weekly fat intake in one sitting. \nRarity: Patrons love Schwartz's like fat kids love pie. Limited supply and persistence over time are contributions to its recipe of success. Expect a plate of succulent smoked meat. \nImitability: Schwartz's brand is inimitable. The \"hole in the wall\" décor speaks to its 80 years of history. This even allows Schwartz's to add merchandizes to its product mix. \nOrganization: Complementary capabilities of staff, supplier and culture.

I went over, got settled on my comfy bar stool and was given the wine menu. The bartender suggested I try this Muscat Sec she had and it was delicious, so I ordered a glass. I was THEN informed I needed to order an appetizer to go along with it. FROWN (Also the reason for docking a full star - I don't like being tricked into buying something. Had this been the policy, I should have been told when I asked the hostess if I could just have a glass of wine - which was $12, so adding the extra $6 for the cheapest appetizer made for a $20 snack!). \nAside from that bit of tomfoolery, the wine was DELICIOUS (They wouldn't/couldn't give me the vineyard it was from because it was exclusive to Holt but they did offer to sell me a bottle on the spot.) They gave me the latest Holt Men's collection catalogue to peruse while I waited and enjoyed my wine - all in all a very pleasant experience! Great menu from what I saw, but I wasn't really looking for food. A tad expensive, but hey, it's Holt Renfrew - what do you expect! The staff was friendly, nice and easy on the eyes :)"

Sushi was also pretty good. Overall for the food it was pretty good. I must say, very expensive sushi, meals, and drinks. Overall it was about 80 something dollars. +automatic tip + taxes. I believe my boyfriend said he spent $120 that night. \nOne thing that got me upset was the fact that my table of people received all their food while I was the ONLY ONE that didn't received my meal. I just sat there drooling over everyone's food. I raised my hand for them to come and before I asked her anything she replied \"Ma'am, they miss counted so It's coming\". I told her alright because I didn't want my night to be ruined because it just started. But why wasn't I notified that there was a miss count and that I'll have to wait for my food? Why did I have to ask? How RUDE was that? They knew I was the birthday girl and didn't bother to tell me. The service there \nSecond, my boyfriend who paid for the meals didn't tip the waitress because automatically the tip was charged from his card. The waitress decided to get a little attitude when he came back asking if he'd left his card around here. She rudely said \"No. Go see the manager for it.\" The manager gave him his card back. What I hate the most is when waitress and waiters expect tip. I understand they work hard but your job is because you would love to serve us. If I see youre just hungry for money and act all ignorant towards me I will not tip you well.\nThird, my friend had told me a waitress at AZN lied to her saying that the restaurant was suppose to close at 9:30pm. I had reservations at 8pm and I even double checked on the website to make sure I wasn't going to mess with their closing time. Officially, they close 10pm. For some reason the waitress lied to my friend that they were closing soon and they were just waiting for us. Although they said it was fine and they'll just wait... I thought it was weird when I found out they had said this to my friend. They were trying to rush us and faking it out on a smile. They made it seem as if they didn't want us there.\nIf I wanted to waste more money and deal with weird service I'll keep coming. But unfortunately, I won't be coming back."

It's my strong opinion that I caught them red handed not changing my oil filter during multiple oil change services I paid them to do. \nOnce I suspected this was going on I set it up so there would be no doubt in my mind if I was getting ripped off. Sure enough, when I got my car back from my last oil change there the same oil filter was still affixed to the vehicle. I'm not going to go into the method(s) I used to catch this but suffice to say there was no doubt, no doubt in my mind that's what was going on. \nMy opinion is that Findlay Honda out and out ripped me off on oil changes. If I could go back and do it over again I would've turned them in to Honda and the State Atty General's office however, I was just too busy with personal stuff at the time to expend the time & effort to move in that direction (2 jobs, a family, & going to school). What I concluded was going on was not an isolated incident, my opinion is that it was systemic policy of the shop. \nAs the saying goes, 'Your mileage may vary', and again, what I'm stating in this review is my opinion, but I refuse to do business with any establishment that cannot make $ in an honest fashion. \nBottom line: If you have service done at Findlay I would STRONGLY suggest you demand your old parts back and ALWAYS go behind them to ensure you got what you paid for.\nNote: I didn't list when this last happened to me as I don't think it's relevant to the overall reviewing of this business. That said, my guess would be there's been changeover since I last got jammed by them. Furthermore, if I thought it was an isolated incident by a single employee my opinion of them might be different, and I might be willing to give them another shot, but that's not the case and I will NEVER trust any deanship with the Findlay name attached to it ever again. Hope saving $3 on putting a new oil filter in my vehicle was worth losing my business for life Mr Findlay."

So many old places have fallen, leaving the Strip full of more unusable parking lots and deserted buildings that looks more like the scenario of a post-apocalyptic video game than a tourist destination.\nBut not Fremont Street. The Golden Nugget has been upgraded, Binion's is slowly coming back, and after months of disrepair, the Plaza has reopened.\nAnd it looks better. Of course, anything would if one had stepped into the casino as early as this Spring. The place looked like a war zone. But now that it's reopened, it's so much nicer, and updated, and cleaner, with new restaurants and the like.\nThat's not to say that it's all perfect. There are still quite a few areas that they are working on, and some spots need some TLC that at least looks like it IS coming. But I am a little surprised that they opened up as much as they did without it ALL being \"ready\". Or at least open up smaller sections at the beginning. I saw some of the hallways during construction last Spring, and it truly did look like Hell on Earth. They still haven't worked that overall look out of some of the areas.\nHonestly, I think they opened up a little too early. It does take some of the \"Wow\" factor out of the mismatch of brand new and still utterly trashed styles. But I'm giving them credit for the fact that they ARE fixing the place and refurbishing the whole thing, rather than just shutting the place down and demolishing it. I'm sure some casino property owners wailed and gnashed their teeth upon realization that something older than 7 minutes was still left standing in the city.\nThe four stars is in support of what they have done to reinvigorate the place, what they are trying to do, and for just not giving up. I'll keep checking back to see how the old girl is doing as she gets back on her feet."

When checking in there was probably (no exaggeration) 60 people standing in line waiting to check in and about 4 people actually checking them in. We stood in line for about 45 minutes waiting. That sucked because The Mirage had us in our room within 15 our last visit.\nNext, WHAT THE HELL IS THAT SMELL!?!?!?! When you open any door to enter the casino there is this OVER WHELMING sweet smell that reminds you of your great grandma's perfume. A hybrid of cleaning product, and the perfume dept for sure. Yeah, you got used to it after a while, but it was VERY unpleasant walking in each time and getting a nasty whiff of that funky smell.\nWhen we got into our room we had a view of the strip and the pool....It was Ok. Nothing special. Especially when looking at the tops of 2 parking garages. I would've rather had a view of the pirate show personally. The room appeared clean upon entering, but once we started getting settled in we found that there was cigarette ashes all over the dresser and the glasses in the room were not exactly clean. The bed was AWESOME!! Very comfortable. Probably the only plus to this room.\nNext thing that sucked ass? The elevators. OHHH my lord....who's the dick head that came up with this system? You have to enter the elevator and then insert your room card into a slot and press the floor you want. SOUNDS SIMPLE RIGHT? Well it would be simple if it actually worked!! We found out that one of the slots were actually broken, so that explains the 5 minutes trying to select our floor. Then we find a slot that works, and you have to insert the key....press the floor number....then slowly remove the card. Not only was this a PAIN IN THE ASS when we were drunk trying to get back to the room, but we probably helped 4 other couples through the course of our stay get to the floor they wanted. And the elevators were dirty. There were rose petals in one of the elevators that had been stepped on numerous times and were smashed into the floor smearing reddish colors all over the floor. NORMALLY I wouldn't give a damn, but when it's STILL there 3 days later??? Makes you wonder how efficient the cleaning crew is.\nThe daily 22.40 resort fee?? Please....It's not worth it. I prefer to check out and owe NO money unless I paid for room service or dry cleaning. I knew there was a resort fee, but didn't realize it was a DAILY fee. If the Mirage doesn't need to charge daily, why does the T.I.?? Only reason I keep comparing to The Mirage is because that was our 1st stay when we 1st came to Vegas and it was nothing but awesome with no daily fee, no funky smells, clean rooms and great service. Treasure Island lacked on all of these categories.\nNext time we're going to be aiming for something like PH, or Mandalay Bay...Close to where we wanna be, and looks like a blast. I cant wait for our next visit .......to Vegas that is :)"

    "text": "As a big fan of the Ribeye, I have one piece of advice - if you plan to go on a Friday night, or after any Illini basketball, football, volleyball, or other popular sport game, make sure to call in reservations before you go. I've had 15 minute waits even with a reservation, and 45 minutes plus without. I don't believe they take any reservations on Saturday, so expect a wait.\n \nAmbiance/decor isn't the best, sure, but it serves its purpose. The clientele is comprised largely of older Illini fans, so it works for the Ribeye to have pictures of Illini teams from their glory days. \nThe service here is fantastic. The servers are professional, polite, friendly, and attentive without being overbearing. \nAbout the food... Well, when you go to a place called \"The Ribeye,\" you should probably be in the market for a ribeye. Sure, there's chicken and shrimp, but the ribeye is their pièce de résistance. Honestly, when I started going to the Ribeye around 5 years ago, I feel like the steaks used to be higher quality, which is what keeps me from giving them a 5. Still, the ribeye is brought out on a hot cast-iron skillet/plate, and that sizzle alone can make my mouth water. I recommend either ordering one degree of cooking lower than your normal preference (i.e., if you like medium-rare steaks, order rare) to compensate, or eat your steak as soon as it's served. The highlight for me, however, is the salad bar. There's iceburg lettuce and the standard salad toppings to make your own, or an array of pasta, bean and potato salads (most of which are, indeed, covered in mayonnaise). My personal favorite is comprised of green peas, peanuts, cheddar cheese, bacon and ranch dressing. Is it haute cuisine? No. But it is solid, simple, and delicious. Also awesome - the croutons, made from the leftovers from the fresh French or wheat bread brought to your table.\nThe price isn't terrible. Two people with soft drinks and before tip comes out to $42. The Ribeye isn't world-class, five-star dining, but it does offer good steaks, great salad options, and pleasant service."

So I have this dislike of drinking water in restaurants from the rim of a cup where multiple people have had their mouths there too. lol\nLocation: 5/5\nLove the location, East Las Vegas needs some Asian flavors. Seriously, its hard to find a sushi restaurant or anything in this area. I say PRIME SPOT! There's no competition. This is place has made it to my top 2 spot but hey if I'm closer to here than Monta. I'd go to Fukumimi."

What a horrible experience!\nI was part of a larger group and although our experience was bad, we didn't bother asking for a manager because when the couple next to us politely did so, the manager came to the table and was VERY rude to them. She even went so far as to use racial slurs and call the lady the \"C\" word!!! After that, the manager followed the customers to the front door where she continued to harass them.\nIt's bad enough when your food service sucks but to treat any customer that way is inexcusable.\nNot a chance on earth we will ever return to this God awful place."

That stuff is all true, as far as it goes. My guy and I live right down the street, and have been hanging out here pretty much every other weekend since July 2012. As such, we've spent a decent amount of cash and have even introduced a few new folks to the bar. \nAfter today, however, I'm never going back. We walked over, ready for some Sunday screwdrivers and some hang-out time with the regulars. We even brought a bunch of chocolate to share with everyone while we sat on the patio and caught up. I was carded- totally fair, since this particular bartender had never seen me before- and then... told my license had a weird address, that I couldn't be served, and that I had to leave the premises. Immediately. WHAT?! (For the record, I have an AZ license with an IL address. I asked the DMV lady if that was okay when I went and got the darn thing, and she assured me it was fine). \nThe icing on the cake? The regulars we were going to hang out with didn't even speak up on my behalf! I walked out of there feeling embarrassed and confused- and ready to point anyone who asks to the Woodshed, a similar bar kitty-corner to Final Round. (The drinks are even a little cheaper). What the hell, guys? I know your regular clientele probably spends more money in a day than me and my boyfriend do in a month at your bar, but we were fairly loyal customers until this happened. Way to lose business and piss off some locals."

    "text": "Out of all the sushi joints that I have been to, I am surprised that I did not yelp about this place. \nAfter what seemed like an eternity of my friend raving about 808, I made her go try it out with me. We went for lunch, because I am a beast and was sure I would regret eating so heavily at night. Instead I would gorge myself and pretend that my body would burn off all the calories during the rest of the day. Although we did not get the full menu, the lunch list was more than adequate.\nWhen we entered the restaurant, it did not look like anything special. There is nothing that stands out in comparison to any other place. \nWhat it lacks in appearance, it makes up for in taste. For appetizers, the tako karaage, agedashi tofu, seaweed salad, and ahi poke are amazing. In fact, I am sure my friend and I could eat our money worth in the last two items. \nThe main reason why I like this place is because they do not overload a roll with rice. The sushi comes out a little smaller than most places, but that is a good thing. It has been so long since I have been here that I forget the names of the rolls. When I go back, I will write out an in depth list. My biggest issue is with the use of soft shell crab. I prefer that it be whole, but at 808 they mix the meat with another fish and sauce. Half the pleasure of soft shell crab is to eat the exterior of the creature. On a positive note, the fish is fresh and you can taste it in the nigiri. I love hirame( fluke, sometimes called halibut), unagi (eel), ahi (tuna), tako (octopus), and sake (salmon). They are all basic, but essential sushi. \nThe staff is friendly and quick, but as our meal was wrapping up the service took a turn. In my mind, it was because they wanted to keep us there and not let us leave. It was the weirdest experience. Usually people give you the bill and just as quickly take it to rush you out. Instead we were left sitting there being asked by the chefs if we wanted more.\nIf you are not an AYCE type then go during happy hour for half off all cut rolls and beer. Monday through Friday from 3pm-6:30pm."

Soon after leaving, a waitress named Ingrid told us she was taking over our table. But Ingrid did NOTHING. Someone else brought our appetizers, food and desserts. Dishes piled at the corner of the table though she repeatedly passed by and my dessert was mushy and melting from having been left so long. \nThere was a table with about 8 to 10 guests a couple tables back and Ingrid along with three other waitresses served on them hand and foot. Too bad the staff couldn't pay attention to other guests. I'm a high tipper but Ingrid got about 50 cents.

Having lived in the valley for most of my life I appreciate the sentimentality. \nBUT! It is important to separate nostalgia from reality, especially when others rely on your opinion when making dinner plans.\nI've lived in the Valley for a good long time- more than 40 years. I've been to Jordan's more times than I can count. \nAs a child, this was one of many local Mexican food restaurants we visited- others being El Maya, Don Jose's, Rosa's, Rosita's, George's Ole, and others. As an adult, part of my enjoyment was the old-fashioned, retro atmosphere- the genuine Naugahyde seats, dark wrought iron, old-school environment. I was even OK with the smooth taco sauce in lieu of chopped and chunky salsa. I tend to stick with the old-school combo plate- taco, enchilada, tostada type combos when I visit.\nMy last two visits have occurred in the last year- most recently in November. The experiences were almost identical- disappointing. It was as if someone in the kitchen had just given up. The taco meat was not really seasoned, very bland, and the shell tasted as if they went and picked up a package at the grocery instead of making their own. The enchilada was rather oily. Food was warm, not hot. Service was friendly but scarce- my drink sat empty more than once.\nThe visit in November is likely my last. I drive by this location at least 3 times a week, and remember wistfully the days when the the food was piping hot, shredded beef well seasoned and the entire taco fresh out of the cooker- crispy and delicious. There are too many good Mexican food places in town, and even for the memories that walking into this places conjures up, I cannot see myself coming back anytime soon. I'll keep my eyes open for an upturn in Yelp reviews, particularly from those who are trying it for the first time.\nAs another reviewer said- be forewarned. You run a great risk of being disappointed."

I'm a big fan of Total Strength, Pilates Mat and Kickboxing. I've also heard the Spin classes are great. I've tried Athletic Conditioning, and while it certainly is an awesome workout, make sure you're at least in decent shape before you partake in that class! It's a rough one. \nAs other reviewers have noted, this gym can get packed especially after 5 pm during the weekdays. So be patient while parking. Some classes can get a bit crowded too, so keep that in mind when you're sprawling out your mat or equipment. \nI haven't had any issues with theft in the locker room, but I'm a big proponent of a big papa lock on my locker.

I was SO wrong!\nI checked out their website ahead of time, which has a \"vegan\" tab for each Ike's location, so I was already familiar with some of the vegan offerings. But when I arrived, there were so many more options jumping out a me. Luckily, the employees know their stuff when it comes to their vegan menu, and they were able to answer my questions.\nI ordered the Handsome Owl (sans cheese): vegan chicken, teriyaki, Wasabi Mayo, lettuce, onions, pickles, & banana peppers, on Ike's World Famous Dutch Crunch bread. OMG! I don't know what sorcery they used to conjure up that bread's amazing and unique flavor, but it is phenomenal! The combinations of all the flavors that encompass the sandwich is ingenious. My mind is blown. It's a $10 sandwich, but it's huge, filling, and worth every single penny. I will certainly return to try all of the vegan combinations. \nThey sell Zapp's potato chips, which come in a variety of colorfully named flavors, like \"Voodoo Heat,\" \"Hotter'N Hot Jalapeño,\"Sweet Creole Onion,\" etc. Looking at the ingredients on the bags (and I have since checked Zapp's website), it appears that only the Salt & Vinegar, and BBQ Ranch chips are not vegan (they contain a milk product), and all except the Mesquite BBQ are gluten-free. However, the source of the natural smoke flavor and \"natural flavor\" needs to be confirmed. I also spotted MSG in at least one flavor.\nI tried the Hotter'N Hot Jalapeño chips. I wasn't impressed. 0 heat. Not 1 hint of spice. And the taste was a little off; almost on the stale side, but the bag showed a November expiration date. Not sure what that was about. Next time I'll try a different flavor to see if there's any change. \nManagement informed me of the following:\n50% of the veggie sandwiches can be made vegan upon request. \nThey use Daiya for the vegan cheese, Tofurkey for the vegan turkey, and Gardein for the vegan chicken and meatballs. \nAll of their breads are vegan except for the wheat (it's honey wheat).\nThe wasabi mayo is automatically vegan, so no need to request a vegan version.\nTheir Dirty sauce is not vegan, but they offer a vegan version, (which is delicious, btw! Add it to your sandwich, or get it on the side and dip your sandwich in it. YUM!)\nFries (called \"Air Fries\") are vegan; they are baked, not fried.\nTater tots are vegan. \nNot vegan:\npesto, & honey mustard sauces, the fried foods, like onion rings & beer battered zucchini (egg based batter), and the obvious (meats and non-vegan cheeses). \nCORRECTION: Their Sun-Devil (a nod to Arizona State University/ ASU) is not vegan, & they do NOT have a vegan version. (The photo I added is actually their vegan Dirty sauce.)\nTheir veggie bacon is vegetarian; not vegan\nGluten-free bread available upon request.\nI love the way it's decorated. It has a very warm, happy, and welcoming vibe. Friendly and vegan-knowledgable employees. Fountain drinks or bottled drinks available. Open late (until midnight) on Fri/Sat. There are few outside tables. Located in the heart of Tempe, next to the Bank of America off Mill, between 6th & 7th. Typical downtown Tempe street or paid lot parking.\nSANDWICHES = MIND BLOWN!"

    "text": "Shocked no one has reviewed this yet? Or maybe i just couldn't find it but I searched really long and hard lol\nVENUE:\nCute little restaurant tucked in one the corners of the Aria Hotel. Atmosphere is intimate, with dim lighting (even at 10AM in the morning). Décor is pretty modern with regular seating and bar area seating. We were sat in the bar area - tables were small but they had this small mini table pull out (very clever and smart) for additional space. Also the chairs were super comfy. Basically like mini couches (to me), which makes me wonder how wonderful the regular area seating is if they were reluctant to sit us near the bar. I'm really not sure if this place is supposed to be more chinese or thai as there are both kinds of dishes on the menu.\nFOOD/DRINK:\nDim sum is pretty standard so far. Got the har gow and siu Mai. As far as taste goes, a speaking as someone who has tasted Dim Sum from some solid areas (San Francisco, Houston, etc.), I would say that it was not phenomenal. Not bad, just not what I prefer. If I had to describe the taste in a sentence, it would be, \"Dim Sum for the average American.\" Not to be offensive or anything, but my opinion is that you would like it if you haven't had better. All in all it was still pretty good, and my kudos goes out to the amount of shrimp they packed in each bite. That was one pleasant surprise that I enjoyed. \nOf course, anyone who has eaten dim sum understands that you will never get full from it, so in addition to this Chinese morning tapas, we ordered off the menu. One of my favorite and wisest foodies told me that if a Thai restaurant doesn't offer Lard Na on their menu then they're not really authentic. I decided to dare Lemongrass and asked my server if they would make Lard Na for me. Two surprises: the first being that she knew that the dish was, and the second was that she was super accommodating about wanting to get it made. She even knew that there are various way you can serve the dish (more gravy like or a soupy pho-style). She charged me for the price of the Pad see ew. When it arrived, the beef was nicely marinated and tender. The noodles were slightly bland, but I will forgive it as it was not an item they typically make and serve. I should have known better because the gravy sauce with Lard Na takes a long time to get right.\nSERVICE: \nOur hostess and server were extremely helpful. As we were in the bar area, the bartender was also helpful and came to check up on us. At the end when we were paying, my card had gotten rejected, and he came back and made some remark (I'm sure he intended it to be comedic) about how I should have let my boyfriend pay. I was slightly miffed and after making sure there was nothing wrong with my account (as many of you wanderlusters know, the bank might think someone stole your card if you suddenly make a purchase on the other side of the country), I asked the bartender to swipe it again. It went through. To which, he commented, \"Yeah make sure there's funds in there.\" Really dude? I don't need your accounting advice."

The pizza dough consistency is great too. \nThey have some great salads too. The best (in my opinion) is the one with kale and quinoa (can't remember what it's called). So good.\nThey have complimentary valet parking, so remember to bring a couple dollars in cash to tip them. They also have parking in front, but it's usually packed."

Was a little taken aback by the mandatory valet parking but relaxed when I saw it was complimentary - a very nice touch. \nThe place was crowded with people who all seemed (for lack of a better word) relaxed. Well heeled too I'm sure. I was going to a college alumnae club event, but wasn't sure I would go so far for brunch on my own. \nOnce we went into the building, it was really cool to imagine it being someone's private home - it was very welcoming! As were the people. The friendliness and quality of service was excellent. \nHowever, given the price, I was very surprised and disappointed with the food. For brunch, there was a plate of small breakfast breads on the table - for 8 people we each got one. No one asked if we wanted more, or offered the fruits or breakfast meats included in the brunch. \nWe also had our choice of 3 possible entrees. Being on an Eggs Benedict kick, I naturally gravitated to that. Mentally, I had a moment of fondly remembering the Daily Dose with their 7 options - here there was one. \nWhen it came, it was short on Hollandaise. There was a tiny pile of potatoes on the side, mixed with some orange (squash?) vegetables. Now, at the risk of sounding really nit-picky, but I would have liked to know what \"hacienda potatoes\" were before getting them and the option to get them plain. The whole plate (artistic vision aside) just looked empty before I even touched it ... \nAnyway, the potatoes were left. I left hungry.\nMH's strawberry and mascarpone stuffed brioche french toast was ok, too sweet for my taste. \nGiven the gaps in what they advertised and what we were offered, I figured it was roughly an extra $12 per person for unlimited coffee and the one pastry. \nThe coffee was surprisingly good. We filled up at a central station, and the server refilled our cups for us. Very nice of him, since he had to walk to the urn for each cup. No cream on the table - surprising - so he had to make a couple repeat trips. Not for me, after the first time - I hate to put people out to do things like this for me - but you'd think it would be better planned. \nSo my experience was mixed. Surroundings and service awesome - food not so much. Value for money - very low. If I enjoyed everything it would have been worth it but as it was, no. If I had a choice I would rather go to Daily Dose and donate the difference balance to charity."

How are you going to have an optometrist location without a doctor?\n - Pressure - They try to push the brand of contacts that will give them their commission and make it terribly difficult for you to get the one you want.\n - Price - With insurance, their fitting prices are about $20 more than their competitors.\n**Story**\nOne Saturday, my usual optometrist was booked solid and I was in great need of new contacts, so I gave Elite Eye Care a try. Big mistake. I came in looking for a contact lense prescription for my current brand and a glasses prescription in case I wanted to get new glasses later. After taking the exam, they \"forgot\" to write me a glasses prescription. I mentioned it and they apologized. Tricky tricky.\nThe next week I'm trying to buy my contact lenses at Sam's Club and they told me the contact lense prescription was for Acuvue 2 and not my current brand. Well played Elite Eye Care. Well played. I call Elite Eye Care up to tell them I wanted my current brand and they told me they just have to fax over a release form for me to sign and send back. I did that and due to their slow response time, it took an hour. Guess what, they sent over the exact same Acuvue 2 prescription even though I specifically told them that was the problem. I called them again and they changed their story. They now told me I have to come in and get \"refitted.\" Unfortunately, because they wasted an hour, they were closing and I couldn't do it that day. I told them I'd come in next Saturday, and they told me it'd be fine since the \"refitting\" would only take a second.\nNext Saturday, I come in and they tell me there's no doctor in. At this point the trial lenses they gave me is past due, so I gave in and bought Acuvue 2. Unfortunately, I let them win.\n**Recommendations**\n - I would definitely not recommend this place unless frustration and inconvenience brings you joy."

I read all the (Zagat) hype, heard all the praise, and, on more than one occasion, mentioned the reviews of it being the \"Best Thai in North America.\"\nAll in all, it ended up being a huge letdown and I was embarrassed at bringing a large party of 8 to this restaurant and making reservations one month in advance. \n1) Location - Lotus of Siam is located in the middle of a strip mall and it isn't an easy location for most cabs to find. The neighborhood is questionable and in the evenings is probably not the safest locale.\n2) Decor - reflective of its strip mall location, the interior is nothing special. There are, however, typical Thai touches (flowers and statues) and plenty of newspaper articles touting it's reputation as a great Thai restaurant.\n3) Food - While many reviews talk about the amazing flavors and the incredible tastes, I found everything to be absolutely average. Given the high expectations, I was obviously disappointed, but even without those expectations, I'd be hard pressed to even call the food good. All the dishes chosen were \"signature\" dishes recommended by our waiter and each failed to impress.\nWith every bite I took, I just wondered how the heck the Gourmet magazine food review could be so off and what kool-aid all the reviewers were drinking. Even now, I can think of a dozen Thai restaurants better than Lotus of Siam and probably only one or two that I've considered worse. \nIn the end, as I waited 45 minutes for a cab to pick up our group from the seedy strip mall location, I figured it all must be a tourist trap. One stellar review must have spawned the rest or maybe, none of the people who were gushing over Lotus had ever been to a Thai restaurant. \nFor the Las Vegas that is home to the $4.99 Steak and Egg breakfast and the 24 hour buffet, Lotus of Siam may be a revolutionary restaurant. But for North America?? Lotus of Siam falls amazingly flat."

It's on a cart so that's cool and I didn't feel like stuff was \"reheated\" but the whole dynamic of how it all ran and being able to get the dish you wanted and when you wanted just didn't flow very well - probably due to the small dining area.

We finally visited this place after hearing about it from even before coming to Arizona. It is a bit of a legendary location in the local community.\nThe atmosphere reminded me of a loud, crowded cafeteria, which is not my style for dining in. I found the ordering process to be unpleasant. You basically stand in a huge line and wait for the burgers to be cooked, which does take a few minutes. Meanwhile, the line interweaves with people who are placing orders, so everyone is in everyone's way. Then, once you receive your food, you wait another 5 or so minutes for someone to come to the register and cash you out. Ironically, while you wait with your ever-cooling food at the register, you are faced with a sign that explains how they only accept cash because it keeps the line moving fast...\nThe burger itself was pretty good, but nothing unique or special. As I mentioned, it really makes you think of that classic American grilled burger. One thing that I liked was the condiments bar, which allows everyone to add their own extras to their plain burger. In particular, I noticed that the tomatoes, pickles, and jalapeños were all extremely fresh. It's hard to get a decent tomato at a Subway or a even a 20-star fancy restaurant, so I commend this place for serving such fresh toppings. In addition, I took a bite of a very tasty not-so-all-American garden burger, which tells me some of the non-traditional burgers may be worth trying."

Badgering them at eleven in the morning, my friends were dismayed at the fact that the burgers and fries were separate. Regardless, we ordered the Parmesan Truffle fries as well as the Sweet Potato. The former are always a good standby with the sundried tomato aioli on the side. The latter were delicious on their own, but the Yuzu citrus aioli didn't mesh as well. \nMy three friends ordered the Kiki burger after asking for my suggestion while I ordered the Crusty Crab protein style. I've never had an issue with long waits for food like other reviewers have. The food came out quickly, and we began devouring. My friends loved the bun, but one of them complained that the flavor of the burger only hit midway through. My \"burger\" was a crab cake atop lettuce, tomato, avocado and onion, garnished with a Tarragon Remoulade and mango chutney. It was tasty, a bit on the salty side. Yet, it was a disaster to eat. It fell apart after a bite, and attempting to get all of the accoutrements in one bite proved a challenge.\nAs for service, one of my friends commented that she felt the need to beat them down in the nicest way possible. Our waters were constantly refilled without the need to pull out the \"I'm dying of thirst\" look at the staff. Our plates were cleared out before we could react. It was definitely the epitome of attentive. \nOverall, good food and service makes for a happy Diana.

A quesadilla should not be served cut up in to slices and stacked on top of each other if the slices are so watery with oil, so underdone, so glutinously sticky that each slice cannot be pulled away from that below it. And what's with the bizarre \"chipolte\" sauce poured over my stacked mass? It was like watery mayo with orange coloring. Foul beyond words. The pico de gallo was okay, though! But then there was the side salad. Old tasting lettuce, chunks of flat-fridge-tasting tomato and croutons that came out of a stale bag left open since... not sure when. I don't think I have left a salad untouched in years, until today. How was the dressing for the salad? Oh, hi, nice to see you Mister Plastic Bottled blue cheese. \n- 1 Star/ + 1 Star - Server. I sat at the bar, and with about 12 stools available, there was only one other taken, so it was not busy. The bartender was attentive, not neglectful. But there could have been some warmth, some pleasantry? Right? I mean, take a few moments to ask... something beside the basics - whatcha want? No?\n+ 1 Star/-1 Star - The music. It's like the 80's are alive, and kicking here at the ole Sangria. Sort of cool but not as this is just not *that* sort of place.\n- 1 Star - The Price. Once again, as with the other eaterie on property, it's like they know they have you by the short-hairs. A quesadilla and small salad for about $20, without any drink (water! free!)? Ridic.\nThere isn't much more to say about this place other than it is the 2nd restaurant on the premises of the Scottsdale Resort and Conference Center. I understand that the pool bar (which was not open the few days I was here) serves food from Sangria's, so SSDD is the vibe. What Sangria's and it's snazzier (but still crappy) sister joint, the Palm Court, need is a food facelift. They could get away with being mediocre in so many other ways (decor, out-dated vibe in general) if the food was good. But it's not even fresh! \nThis resort needs to step up their food game. Maybe they can get away with serving slop to the conventioneers, but the fact that they had rooms available at last minute notice when the rest of Scottsdale was booked up speaks mightily to the poverty of their food quality. Again, a sad \"avoid\" vote."

Super disappointed.\nI was here three years ago, for my birthday, and remember it being A LOT better.\nWe made a reservation online, and were seated quickly...it was our anniversary, and like I said, I hadn't been there in 3 years, and my guy had never been there.\nFirst off, I know it's minor, but it is very dimly lit in there... So, factor that in with the noise factor, and you can barely recognize what you are being offered/served. We arrived during 'Happy hour'....that is only offered in the bar. Can't really enjoy that with a child, can we? But our waitress, who didn't offer her name, nor had a name tag told us that she \"wouldn't mind if we went to the bar to get a drink.\"\nOh, how gracious of you.\nI saw that they had a coconut mandarin mojito, that didn't sound very appetizing to me, so I asked if there was a way to do a pineapple one. The waitress said that would be no problem. The $12 mojito should be left to the Cuban Cuisine at Havana Grill......Sorry, Brazil.\nWords can't describe the taste... Barely any pineapple, I felt like it was over poured, or mixed wrong....I guess that's what I get for asking for a custom drink.\nThe salad bar was probably the highlight. The little circles hardly mean anything to the servers. After we had decided that some of the meat was either salty, or too tough, we had flipped all three of the circles provided to red. However, we were constantly interrupted by servers. At least 6 times.\nThe best meat that we had was the bacon wrapped chicken. It was moist, flavorful, and perfectly seasoned..and the lamb chop...even though it was gamey-er than any other lamb that I have ever had...Everything else was just kind of a miss. My guy stopped eating a lot earlier than I did, he said that he was feeling funny....\nWell, that funny feeling had hit BOTH of us by the time we got home. We felt severely nauseated....I have never felt this way so quickly after eating food.\nNeedless to say, $120 (before tip, with 1 drink), is way too much for us to pay to get sick."

If you do come on by, ask for Jesse or Jean-Carlos. Both waiters have been the best so far. Even this year when there was a set menu, the waiters will try to accommodate you. The usual holiday pizza is pizza marghareti. Pizza Cristina is the one we usually order which has proscuitto ham. We got that instead of the regular pizza that was on the set menu. The staff is very warming and you feel like you are in Italy when you dine here. The risotto is to die for. We tend to either order the linguine with the seafood or seafood risotto! To top off that of, we order the tiramisu for dessert. No restaurant yet has been able to beat their tiramisu. Since I live in California, we go to their sister restaurant which is Il Fornaio. Tiramisu is my favorite dessert, overall. When I am gambling myself in the Venetian or Palazzo, I tend to get this craving for the tiramisu. So, I will stop gambling, head over to Canaletto and order a cappuccino and tiramisu. What a treat. When I could be gambling and losing money, I treat myself to a wondrous treat! It does not get better than this! I am in heaven! If you love seafood, come and order the linguine with shrimp, mussels, and clams. If you are not big on seafood, then order the ravioli, or spaghetti. But definitely for sure order the tiramisu! for more my reviews, check out my blog. http://tastypalateandfoodie.blogspot.com"

OK first when we were about to check in at the registry they assumed that we were off our rockers cause we were asking for our two tower suites we had booked months in advance asked us \"are you sure\" like we were some bums on hallucinogens or something. After they realized that we did have two suites booked, they told us that it would take a couple hours,this is just the beginning. We finally get our keys to our tower suites, then right before we even get to the elevator you have to pass some elevator security (which i have nothing against) but these \"elevator security\" stopped our group and said that he wanted to check my cooler. I cooperated fine and he says that i have to much beer in it \"WHAT\"!? i said. So confused as other groups of people have cases and holding Tequila bottles as they walk right by him. He finally said we could proceed after he makes these phony call asking if it was OK to bring a cooler of beer to the room,apperently he wanted a payoff of some sort like he was doing me a big favor. So annoying but we did. We proceed to the hotel which was really nice(ill give the Wynn that). We get ready and go straight to the pool party which we even paid extra for VIP. WE get to the pool and i dint know if they had it out for us or what but again we deal with security!? This time there not letting my friend into the pool cause of his tattoos! Get this, the guy \"Jason\" had tattoos as well just like my friend and he has the nerve to tell us \"paying customers staying at there hotel\" that we were not gonna be allowed in! We tried to reason by saying that he would put a shirt on but they were ignoring us ! We had to leave cause of the embarrassment. It took us about two hours to get reimbursed with no sorry or anything after we spend two hours at the front desk speaking with managers, supervisors etc. I felt bad for my friend for being discriminated for tat toss which half of the people at the pool had! We were singled out and probably a good laugh for there staff for ruining our weekend.Thanks a lot Wynn. I will NEVER EVER EVER STAY HERE AGAIN!"

The roasted duck curry had a lot of flavor, and the coconut rice with mango for dessert- it's at first very different for a dessert, but as you keep eating it, it gets more comforting and enjoyable. I highly recommend calling ahead and getting reservations. This place was definitely worth going, like a YUM YUM GIMME SOME kinda place.

He also had the salad bar (an additional 2.99), so there was enough of the main dish to take home leftovers. We love leftovers!!\nI ordered the surf and turf combo, which was a couple of shrimp in a spicy barbecue sauce, a tiny grilled chicken breast with a fresh mango salsa, and a very small steak. I substituted broccoli for the brown rice, again with no problem. I didn't get the salad bar, but I'm not a big eater, so I had leftovers to go, too.

    "text": "I'm trying to figure out how most folks gave this show anything more than 3 stars...and I'll tell you why.\nWe went Thxgiving holiday weekend (busy time for Vegas). We sat in the right section mid way up (A tad too close). If you go to watch this, you'd be better off sitting further back in the mid section, probably cheaper tickets too and I would only go if you can buy cheap tickets.\nThis show would be a FLOP without the moving stages and sets built into the side of the auditorium. The storyline and performances or lack thereof would not be able to sustain itself without the amazing stages. The moving stage is the highlight of every scene with the performers incorporating themselves into it to give the illusion of moving landscapes, etc. The last battle scene and maybe 1 or 2 other scenes using the moving stage are the best.\nThe entire performance is lacking with imbalanced energy levels from the entire cast. Some performers are extending themselves giving great performances, not spectacular however, whilst others seem to be going through the motions; it was palatable. Either the performers are bored with the choreography or the show in its entirety. There is one main evil character who looks like a cross between a Kiss rock band member and a Japanese warrior, he barely did acrobatics and wasn't in a lot of scenes but when he was on stage, he was captivating...he had stage presence. There was a baton twirler...yeah, a baton twirler who was ok but not anything special that I haven't seen a 16 yr old girl do during a street parade.\nI'm still trying to figure out how the \"Spongebob Squarepants\" scene with people dressed in beach animal character outfits was Cirque du Soleil'ish, they hardly did any acrobatics or feats of the imagination. It was more of a Tom n' Jerry comedy skit...I'm guessing they needed to burn time somehow to prep next scenes but I'm still puzzled by how cheesy this was executed given the opportunity to showcase their \"talented artists.\" Another scene which was \"visually\" captivating for about a whole 3 minutes but lasted 10 minutes way too long was a rope hoisted performer controlled bird contraption where they dragged a screaming main character around (not doing anything acrobatic in nature) the entire front of the stage...bawwwwring!\nAt the end of the show, whilst performers were taking a final bow...many of the performers started undressing right there on stage, taking off masks and clothing. Really?!? ...geez, talking about spoiling a supposed illusion filled performance with undressing performers during audience applause; how unprofessional!!\nFor what the tickets cost, I don't recommend going to this show if you can't get tickets under $75 pp. It is expensive and not nearly worth the $150+ per tix cost that is charged on most sites. Not a lot of acrobatics that I hear most other Cirque shows are known for and I think that's due to the limitation of the size of the moving stage."

The rolls were like 'sub' rolls we are use to having grown up in Massachusetts! \nWe will definitely be going back and I'd love to say we'll try other things but it's really hard to find a great cheesesteak here in AZ so we might just stick with what we know! They also have burgers, hot dogs, gyros, wings, salads and deli sandwiches on the menu.\nOh we also had 2 orders of regular fries and 1 order of garlic fries! All were great and if you like garlic I recommend the garlic fries for sure!\nThe staff was very friendly, the place was busy but the line to order moved very quickly and the food was also served quickly.\nAnd yes, this is my first review!"

I wanted to specify, so I asked if it was impossible to just get a couple of enchiladas....and she said it comes with rice and beans.....Arghhh! What's the deal? But the food was good and she was on top of the refills. But then dessert came around! And so she regaled me with all their desserts and they all sounded good, so I chose the berry cobbler. She said it was her favorite and I was craving some healthy additions to a possibly decadent dessert! So there we waited....30 minutes for that freakin' cobbler! And guess what? No berries!!!! It was an apple cobbler!!!! Now that I think about it, I should have talked to the manager, but after waiting so long and keeping all my friends there, I felt like I was forced to eat it.

It's a burger joint infused with the new spirit the Cosmopolitan brings to the strip: Vegas extravagance while keepin it classy.\nThe ambiance surely is nice, as you would expect in one of the new city center hotels. The waiters are friendly and accommodating. The burgers were delish, though I wouldn't say they were anything beyond what you would expect from a $20 burger kind of place.\nThe thing that makes me want to come back are the shakes. As people have said before, the variety of innovative flavors they have here is phenomenal but can be daunting. Get everyone in your group to get a different one so you can try out lots of flavors! I had a s'mores one that was incredible! Not to mention the presentation of the shakes is a pleasure to the eyes and tastebuds. The marshmallow garnish I think was a homemade marshmallow and was delicious. They do have booze in them, but only enough for taste. They can't really induce or maintain a buzz, so order a drink on the side if needed.\nIs it lame that I wanna take a trip Las Vegas just to get another Holstein's shake?

(Ok, I know Zara has cute clothes but the quality is not up to par). So I asked for another one which took 10min, not bad. BUT, the second one they brought down the stitching on the collar was coming off so I hesitantly asked if they had another one. I don't mean to be picky, but if I'm going to spend $80 on a blazer I don't want to have to go home and fix it. The guy (I hope to god is not the manager because he does not know how to manage or give customer service-had a messy faux hawk and blonde orange hair) grumbled and rolled his eyes went behind the wall and complain to his coworker in Tagalog/English saying \"I don't know what her problem is that's how it's supposed to be\".

I will definitely be coming back again in the future - it's by far the best Italian I've had in Henderson. \nI agree with everyone that says Gaetano's needs to print a Specials menu! The list of 15 specials was so complicated even our waiter couldn't keep it straight. I love that they have specials, but the confusion of listening to soo many and trying to remember them was annoying. \nWe started with beef carpaccio (YUM) and a pretty mediocre bottle of wine. Although I don't blame Gaetano's for the wine - that's my fault for picking the wrong one :)\nI had a 1/2 order of the chicken ravioli and a caprese salad for my main. The chicken ravioli was really good - definitely seemed homemade. The caprese was pretty awful. The mozzarella was yummy, but the olive oil was bland, there was no balsalmic, and they called it \"Caprese con pepperoni\" (I guess I'm an idiot for thinking \"con pepperoni\" implies there is pepperoni in the dish?). They had a huge pile of slimy red peppers in the middle and lots of onions. It was a weird rendition of a Caprese - not one I'd ever order again. \nMy husband on the other hand got one of the best Italian dishes I've had in my life! I had major jealousy that he got to eat such fabulous food while I was picking at my weird Caprese! It was veal stuffed pasta in a cream sauce with proscuitto and peas. It comes with mushrooms but my freakshow of a husband had them leave those out. Seriously this pasta was incredible!!! Even without the mushrooms this pasta was SO GOOD. The veal was so tender and perfectly flavored. Next time I guess we'll just be getting 2 orders of this fabulousness!!\nA wonderful evening with friends and great food. Service was so-so, but the veal stuffed pasta will have me coming back!! Thank goodness it isn't a special and seems to be on the menu full time."

When we walked in there was no one there to direct us to the buffet or a table so we decided to just stand in line and pick up our food after which we had to search for a table and sit ourselves down. We flagged a server and asked for water which came almost at the end of our meal.\nThe food did not have any flavor at all and we felt that we were just stuffing our stomachs rather than enjoying a meal. The masala dosa was uncooked, tandoori chicken bland and i cannot even define the taste of the butter chicken. Finally we decided that you cant go wrong with dal rice but that again was under seasoned and tasteless. The sweet dish mentioned a mangao custard but it felt like thick mango nectar that was sweetened to the point of being inedible.\nWhen the host was informed by one of our group members that the food could have been better he was arrogantly told that the food is purposefully kept bland to suite the taste requirements here. Well it is not about the spiciness of food but the taste that was non existent so we just decided to laugh and walk away."

I'm with Brad T, only 3 stars.... =(\n1. Kunomoto oysters were ordered off menu and pretty fresh and tasty, but I've had better.\n2. By the time we finished our oysters, which was only a few minutes because we eat fast, we started our COLD crab cakes. I don't know about other people's experiences, but we've always had our crab cakes kind of toasty. Though it was crab-a-licious, I was put off by the temperature.\n3. Our 22 oz bone-in ribeye was cooked rare plus and it was delicious! The extra sear with clarified butter is fantastic. However, I was not pleased with the amount of connective tissue in my half of the steak. I felt like I was prepping my own meal by having to cut through all that chewy stuff!\n4. Here's the moment of utmost disappointment. I was thinking about my fluffy, warm and tasty butter cake all night long, and it was a butter cake fail. It was not warm and fluffy as I remember. It was actually almost grainy and almost cold on the outside, save the inside was warm but almost soggy. The wonderful airy whipped cream was actually heavy and too sweet.\nConclusion: For being open for 6 months, should I expect it to be where its other Mastro counterparts are in amazing-ness, or should I expect it to be working out its kinks and be amazing 6 more months down the line? Regardless of kinks or not, I'm a sad puppy because other than the yummy steak mixed with connective tissue bits, everything else was just average compared to my other Mastro's experiences. Mastro's did not rise to the occasion to it's reputation. Will I go back? For the love of butter cake, I will after more time has passed for this particular establishment.\n[side note: If you do try this particular Mastro's, do asked to be sit in the nice atrium with the mollusk looking wooden structure and not right outside of it. I think you will get better service. It seems as if the table we were sitting at is a \"blind spot\". The servers liked to walk over an peer over the railing next to you and chat about the stores and patrons below as if you weren't there.]"

    "text": "It has been so long since I did a review, I feel badly that I am doing this for Jack In The Box. Especially since I had done one a year ago for this same location... But my experience today was so bad I feel it needed to be documented.\nI arrived at 5:05pm. There were two people in front of me at the register. When the man who was ordering was finished the cashier/manager walked away without saying anything. A few minutes had passed and she was still gone. I was 2nd in line and stepped to the Kiosk to place my order. Smart thinking on my part, not waiting till the cashier was back from break (or maternity leave).\nMy order was placed and I waited, and waited and waited. Being tall made it easy to look at the display monitor and see that my order had been in for a little over 10 minutes. But I kept waiting, and waiting.\nAt 15 minutes I flagged down the Drive Thru cashier. I told her it was obvious I was not getting my food, so could I get my money back? She called to the manager in the back that she needed a refund, then looked back at me and said \"your food is ready. Do you want it\"? I told her I would take the food.\nShe scrambled for a moment, then told the manager she better give me the refund. \nAfter a couple minutes of pushing buttons I was given my money back without an apology or even an explanation as to why I wasn't getting my food instead. I did get a snotty comment from her about them being short of help and how she needed to give the cook a break. (Seemed odd that the cook gets his break at 5pm dinner hour and the dining room closes, but like my brother says, \"you can't argue with minimum wage\").\nI went home and began cooking dinner. As it cooked I took the online survey at \"talktojackinthebox[dot]com\" and gave a pretty bad review. Oddly enough, I had little problem with the slow service time. My gripe was the poor way my complaint was handled. \nNow, for the total shocker. In under 5 hours from submitting the online form I received a call from the store's General Manager. At first thought you would be impressed at just how important that feedback is to them. You might assume that someone in the corporate office saw that and called the GM at home to deal with it. As for me, I was thinking \"Who the #@&# is calling me at 9:48pm\"?\nBeing in that restaurant for more than 20 minutes without a single employee acknowledging I was there has me suspect they are out of touch with the customers. Calling me at 12 minutes to ten to talk about it just proves it.\nSo Jack, here is my summary: I love you commercials, but the customer service is worse than deplorable. If being short of help is the problem I will do everything in my power to assist you. By NEVER returning to one of your restaurants you will need less staff, therefore, you are no longer short of help. Problem solved!"

They do have all three. The beef was decent. I had the steak tartare and the New York strip. The tartare is the better of the two. The chopped salad with the peppercorn dressing was better than the caesar as well. That tend to be the trend with most of the items on their menu. If we ordered two items, one was the crowd favorite. I do have to make a special note about the jumbo lump crab cakes. They are spectacular. The separation in meat was impressive. It was predominantly crab. If you want to try more than one side, the option of pick any three for $15 is a small savings. The portions are big, so it is easy to share. We got the jumbo baked potato, corn brulee, and sweet potato wedges. The sweet potato was the favorite. It came with a honey jalapeno dipping sauce. I would definitely order it again if I went back.\nAs for booze, their bartenders are good. I have had better Manhattans, but it was nothing to frown upon. My friend tried a cable car for the first time and enjoyed it. Their specialty drinks all tailor towards the sweet cocktail drinkers.\nThe broads are present as well. As we were being sat, we saw a girl in a gown with a large head dress was walking around. Near the end, she asked if everything was to our liking. \nIf you are downtown and do not want to travel then it is a good option."

And with free admission, there really is no reason to at least come take a peek out of curiosity and stay for a good time that while remind you of when $10 could last you a while. \nGames: This place has an amazing selection of gaming. Their array of pinball machines are generally organized by decade/generation, so it's easy to zig-zag up and down the aisles in a veritable timelines of pinball gaming. They also have an awesome selection of non-pinball old-school gaming from the original Donkey Kong/Super Mario Bros to borderline creepy curiosities of yesteryear like their puppet show game thingy lol. There are also a couple of sights not particularly related to gaming but general entertainment....such as their old Mutoscope (flip-book machine) that depicts an old boxing match from the 20s I think. \nAnd, given the age of these games and how physical people can be (tilting used to be penalty kids), they do have the out of order game here and there but they usually don't stay that way for long. And, if you're like me, you might get a kick out of seeing a pinball machine opened up anyways.\nFood/drink: One thing I enjoy about this place: they always have food and drink that give it the old arcade feel. This goes from the 25 cent popcorn machine to soda machine to 25 cent candy dispensers for when you need a Mike and Ike break in between throwing down on Galaga. \nCost: Admission is free. And all of the games are reasonably priced based on era (older games are a quarter....newer games varying from 50 cents to a dollar perhaps)."

Grub is good portion size, and when it comes to sweet treats my eyes just about fell out my head when I was presented with a slice of red velvet cake the size of a cakey skyscraper. It took me about an hour to eat it!\nIt's usually very busy in here, so service can sometimes suffer due to the sheer volumes of people. But all in all, a place I come back to again and again. \nPlus, they have a loyalty card!"

    "text": "Okay, so I have frequented at least 4 different Greek places in Vegas and have yet to find one I REALLY liked. I generally judge a Greek Restaurant on two things. First is their dolmades (stuffed grape leaves) and the second is their tzatziki (the cucumber yogurt sauce you usually get on gyros). This place delivered on both! \nI actually ended up ordering an appetizer sampler (as I don't eat meat, the appetizers are where the good stuff is). I ordered the dolmades, hummus, baba ghanoush, and tzatziki, which came with pita (although not enough pita to eat everything. I had to order more). For the most part everything was DELICIOUS!! The hummus did need a little more lemon juice for my taste, but that was an easy fix as they serve the platter with a wedge of lemon. The dolamdes were served cold, which I found I tend to like better. They had really good flavor and were a decent size. The baba ghanoush had a good smoky eggplant flavor and the tzatziki...OH, the tzatziki....it was so thick, creamy, and smooth (I mean, despite the fact that there were bits of cucumber in it - you know what I mean). GREAT flavor...a hint of dill, refreshing cucumber, a the distinct flavor of garlic (not overpowering, just a hint). It really is some of the best tzatziki I've had...even at \"authentic\" Greek places. \nMy bf got a gyro platter and he thought it was really good as well. It came with a side of fries which were REALLY good. They were a thicker cut fry with a crispy outside and velvety soft center. I really didn't know potatoes could have such a light texture. They were also coated in a kind of seasoning, although not overpowering. It may just be the oil they fried them in. TIP: Dip the fries in the tzatziki....oh so, so good.\nThe only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is that they don't have a vegetarian platter. Yes, they have a falafel platter and a Spanakopita platter, but not a platter with the stuff I got on it. While I enjoyed the appetizer sampler, it was ALOT of food (I shared and still had a lot of leftovers) and it cost $14.95 (the gyro platter was only $7.95 - is that me being cheap?). I would have much rather had smaller portions of each with maybe two falafel. It would have been perfect. \nBut really...I will definitely go back to this place when I can...it's a bit of drive for me, but it's well worth it!"

If you step foot into this place, its a risk that would be equivalent to doubling down on a 20.\nAnyhow, I've gotten sick here literally everytime that I've been. Something is not right about the food here and nothing about the food pops out. It's a bit on the smaller side, you'll notice walking to every stand whereas other buffets will make you take a few trips before you've seen everything. I think we've only gone here for sheer convenience... poor stomach, how I have wronged you so!\nI was upset because they took away the smoked salmon a lot earlier than they should have and to top it off, they said come back in 5 minutes for some more only for it to be replaced by some generic dish I could easily get at Hometown Buffet.\nI'm glad the last time I came here I got the champagne brunch because if I was a bit more cognizant of everything going on, I would have definitely been more upset. \nAvoid, NEVER again.

    "text": "I believe that \"Weiss\" is German for white. How appropriate. The food couldn't get any more white, bland and tasteless.\nI was really eager to try this place. The pictures looked great, the reviews were good, and I saw on the menu that they had cabbage soup, which I loved from Foxy's and from Jackie's in Commercial Center- two late lamented delis which reveal how incredibly old I am.\nSo, and equally decrepit friend and I grabbed our walkers and shuffled on down.\nIt was busy, but we were seated quickly and service was efficient if not particularly friendly. So far, so good. \nWe were disappointed that they didn't bring us a dish of pickles or a basket of rye bread, which were standard in the aforementioned old-school spots, but then, nobody pumps your gas for you anymore, either, so still o.k.\nI was trying to be conservative on calories so I had a 1/2 brisket on rye with cabbage soup, my friend went wild with a triple decker concoction involving corned beef, pastrami, and cole slaw.\nFirst, we got the soup. I was expecting a rich, tangy, tomato base. This was more brown. You know how when you cook soup and store it overnight it's usually better the next day? Well, this was more like they had been reheating it and keeping it hot every day for about a week so it just tasted old. The accompanying hard toasted bagel slices were clearly a creative use of leftovers that would have been thrown away. I am a crostini fan so I liked them. My friend did not.\nThen came the sandwiches. They looked good. Until I opened mine to add mustard. The brisket was mostly fat, and wet, soggy fat at that. Like catching a glimpse of myself getting out of the shower. Her pastrami and corned beef were almost tasteless. Again, I think they sliced the meat and held it in hot water repeatedly until they managed to leach out any semblance of flavor. \nThe only thing they didn't soak were the pickles, which still tasted raw. After sampling those and the flavorless rye bread, I no longer yearned for the free samples.\nI will say that the chicken noodle soup looked great, as did the breakfast ordered at another table. But ours LOOKED good, too. And what does it say about a menu where the standout is chicken soup? Bland, bland, bland."

Let me rephrase that, when I smell... maybe that isn't the right word to use... let's just say: when I experience it.\nDespite that I do not like the smell of Currie and most Indian food looks unsightly to me, there is something to be said about the food here. It is cooked well and has a certain richness being full of the unique complexities you might expect in well prepared Indian food. I have had bad Indian food before: dry, bland or grossly over seasoned and spiced but you will only find good food here.\nOn my visit, my friends and I ordered sampler platters that featured a variety of different Indian dishes. We only ordered two samplers for the four of us but so much food came out that they had to slide an extra table over to accommodate it all. I feel we really got more than our money's worth eating here.\nAs for the environment, it is really nothing special. The decor is sparse and the furnishings are dated and low budget. Don't go expecting Taj Mahal surroundings, you will get far more enjoyment if you focus on the food and your good company."

Unfortunately we both ordered the brisket ( i would have liked to see another entree), but it worked out in a way. The sweet potato fries were amazing and the brisket was cooked very well. We marveled at how well the brisket was. The only problem I had was the suace was a little too tangy, but my friend thought it was great. To each their own I guess. The price wasn't too bad and this will def be a place i repeat. The only problem I had was parking as there was no parking on any roads that day."

BLAND BLAND BLAND. Fortunately they have malt vinegar there so I could add a little flavor. Mayo helped as well. I had capicola and cheese. Everything was just tasteless from the slaw to the meat. The fries arent bad but it doesnt make a sandwich automatically good by smashing a bunch on them. I'm a big fan of the idea but this was not satisfactory. My friend had the cheese steak which was a processed cube of steak. He was also dissatisfied. The beer mightve been the best part. I was turned on to Yuengling during my visit and am not a lager fan but it is a tasty beer! The service was acceptable but we did end up there around 4:30. The thick, handcut slices of bread are pleasing but it gets served in a small basket and impossible to find the bottom of the sandwich. Very messy. \nOh and I heard them saying they had 38 loaves of bread left at about 5pm on a Fri night. They claim to be open til 2am. You do the math. \nI may try a sandwich at the original location at some point in my life but my initial impression was a total letdown."

Eventually someone asked me \"you here for pickup?\" I told them that I was not and wanted to order. They seemed as if my order was taking them away from more important orders and made me feel rushed to make decisions. I ordered at 12\" thin at 7:05pm(approx) and it was handed to me at 7:40pm. 35 minutes to cook a thin crust 12\" pizza for a customer in the lobby? Bollocks to that.\nI will say, the pizza crust was good, but nothing you can't find elsewhere. The 6 tables they had in the lobby looked almost like they were put there for looks, not for people to stay and eat. Other people came and went as I waited for my pizza and were treated the same way I was. \nEDIT: I did go back and they were nicer. Must have hit them on a real busy night.

But I had a couple of friends that were more interested in enjoying each other's company and laughing at the ridiculousness of the place. So off I went.\nWe had adjoining rooms, one with a king bed an the other with two queens. The beds were comfortable and soft, leaving me rested for long evenings of silliness and debauchery. The rooms were minimally, but tastefully, decorated and the bathrooms were huge. Other than the safe and refrigerator, there were few extra amenities. But, given that we were getting both rooms for dirt cheap prices (two rooms for two nights: under 200 dollars total), I can't complain too much. The household staff kept the rooms tidy and there were no early morning interruptions (particularly annoying when you have the \"Do Not Disturb\" sign up.)\nAnyway, living in California, I've become used to all buildings being smoke free...which obviously is not the case in Vegas. The air filtration system certainly helped. But there was also a fragrance they add to hotel casino to cover up the smell of smoke. This was a bit of an annoyance, as the smell nauseated me: kind of sickly sweet vanilla marshmallow.

I really appreciated the fact that they helped us make decisions and were really honest about everything. The waiter even offered to pay for our entrees if we felt disappointed in our choices! Surely he meant \"comp,\" but, regardless, it was nice to know I wouldn't suffer Buyer's Remorse on such an expensive dinner choice! \nOne thing I found remarkable, and perhaps this helps achieve their high rating, was that a member of our party requested a (fairly common) sparkling water which they did not have. The waiter actually had someone from the bar leave the restaurant and acquire some for her. Woh. That right there was mind-blowing to me. \nTheir wine list was particularly impressive, but asininely expensive. Expect to pay hundreds of dollars for modest bottles of wine. I'm fairly certain I even saw a bottle listed at around $30,000! I'm sure it was a Lafite Rothschild or something. The sommelier (read: a REAL sommelier) actually complimented my two choices! If that was genuine or not, I don't care. The words \"excellent choices, sir\" actually came out of his mouth. Brownie. Points. Mister. \nNow to the food: everything was excellent. I mean, it was just...excellent! I don't even know what to say beyond that except that my dessert was a ball of ice cream in a spherical shell of chocolate topped with gold leaf (I ate gold!) and had a hot ganache poured over it, thus revealing the dairy insides. \nThe decor was so much fun, the restaurant is small and intimate, and if you get the table in the corner on the left when you first enter the dining room, you can watch the Bellagio fountain show from your table!\nIf you're willing to spend the money, you will not be disappointed in your experience her. It was true Vegas decadence and I loved every minute of it."

The decor is somewhat simple, but much nicer than it was as City, & it's a very comfortable place to eat. They have added walls to divide the dining area into three rooms so it's not so cavernous, & the food today was excellent! I was joined by Mike C. & Robyn N. to give it a try, & there were 129 main food items out, including a Mongolian style BBQ, & a good number of tasty, properly presented Sushi treats.\nThe fare here is not unusual, somewhat the same as you expect at a Chinese Buffet this size, but everything was delicious, the right temperature, kept well stocked, & the service was friendly. It beats their other \"Yummy\", the pricing is LOW at $5.99/$5.39 Sr., & with no shortcomings I have to say they've earned 5 Stars here! :-))"

Although we didn't have to wait for a table (cuz we choose the bar seats), and the servers were very nice, but the wait for the actual food were absurd (total of at least an hour). And the food weren't that good. We ordered :\nThai iced tea\n-- too sweet, you can't taste the flavor of the tea\nChicken satay\n-- decent, all because of the peanut sauce , the chicken is basically tasteless, if you don't dip the sauce\nAwesome flat noodle\n--it's a funny dish to me, it got sweet and burn flavor mixed\nShort rip fried rice\n--claim as their signature dish, but the pull beef is too salty. Since its too salty, you can't taste anything. I could not finish it."

There is a restaurant which seems to do pretty good business. I popped in before 7 on a Friday for a takeaway and it was pretty full which is always a good sign, with lots of other popping in to collect takeaway too.\nTheir takeaways are awesome. First visit at New Years was for meal deal for 2 and we added extra bits (pakora, naan, extra rice) on to make it a meal for 3 - seriously, there was tons of food, even feeding three with pub munchies, meant there was still another meal and a bit left for another day. Meat is cooked amazingly - we had a chicken korma and there was a lamb dish with mint whose name escapes me. I would never order lamb normally and didn't intend on even trying it but it was awesome. Totally melt in the mouth gorgeousness. \nI tried to look for it last night but probably missed it on the menu due to tiredness and starvation so I opted for a chicken dupiaza. It was lovely, subtly spiced tomatoey sauce with huge chunks of tender chicken and slices of red and green peppers and onions - yum! I ordered boiled rice to go with it and when I opened the bag at home, not only did I have my order, but a 2 little tubs containing a chopped onion salad and some mango chutney. I think this is a Jashans thing as there is always some kind of salad and sauce thing that comes extra which is a nice touch. \nSo, yep, Jashans is worth checking out. There are deals on for the restaurant on Sundays, and lunchtimes during the week,if you fancy a bargain lunch treat. The staff are lovely and the restaurant is really nicely decorated, very modern, but with lots of red, orange and gold accents to reflect the Indian and Bangladeshi theme."

Instead, we got flat-out terrible food. My husband got lamb kafta that was pulled straight from the freezer. I got a vegetarian plate that had an inedible spinach pie. It tasted very old and dried out. The stuffed grape leaves were ok, but even the canned ones from Trader Joe's taste better. The falafel was absolutely the worst falafel that my husband and I have ever tasted. There were no visible spices or onions in the patty. So horribly bland other than the taste of old oil. My husband's Turkish coffee was nothing like we had in Turkey. It wasn't bad, but it was more like chai than the dark tar that is turkish coffee. We usually like to try baklava at Mediterranean restaurants in hopes of finding something close to what we had in Turkey, but we didn't want to risk further disappointment.\nThe service was friendly though, and that's the only thing keeping me from giving them one star."

We are blessed to have so many world class facilities to choose from when deciding on a spa day or just a massage. I've been in the Spa industry for eleven years now and as a Licensed Massage Therapist, it is important for me to maintain good health. That's how I view most massages, as maintenance, not a luxury or pampering. Although most people would differ from my opinion, massages are essential for good health.\nEach visit to the Spa at Talking Stick has been good, very good, not great though. I agree with many of the other reviewers here on Yelp, the Spa entrance ought to separate from the casino. The first time that I visited, finding the Spa entrance was challenging and odd; walking through a smoky, loud casino floor is not the way to calm the mind and to relax. \nAfter taking the correct set of elevators and arriving at the Spa, the reception area is modest and practical. The front desk is knowledgeable and friendly, each of the 3 times that I've been, making sure that an attendant from the Men's Locker Room is there to great me. As a \"Spa Dude\", I'm a big fan of the large showers, great desert views and openness that is part of the space design here. Also, if you time it well, you can have the locker room and wet area All To Yourself! Almost like a private spa retreat!\nThe massage therapist here are a talented group, they've been hired because of the intuitive touch, caring demeanor and for being experts in their craft. With that said, we all have our days that we are off. Please be kind and patient if you visit on a busy Saturday or Sunday during Spa Week. I can only imagine how hectic it is in the Women's Locker Room during these 2 weeks every year ( April & October).\nThe Spa at Talking Stick also offers great specials & offers to locals year round. Visit their website to the see the latest ones prior to scheduling. I will return again and savor the lounging deck (with views of Four Peaks and the Superstition Mountains) just off of the hallway near the co-ed relaxation area, It is the perfect place to chill and to be at one."

Everything about this place, including the name is mediocre. We walked into the restaurant which looks like an old beat up hole in the wall that should be featured on Chef Ramsey's Kitchen Nightmares. Warning! The place looks nothing like the pictures featured on it's website. I ordered a turkey sandwich (hold the cheese, hold the mayo), add avocado, and add cucumbers. The avocado was an additional 1.50, which wasn't a big surprise considering most places up charge for avocado. I was appalled to see that I was charged .45 for cucumber after the check arrived. Get real, The Deli, a whole cucumber costs that much. My husband got a meatball sub which was decent. It wasn't anything special and he said he likes Subway's meatball sub even better. My children split the mac n cheese meal and it was fine. Again nothing special. The atmosphere is horrendous. We sat on the patio facing Queen Creek's finest meth lab, a boarded up house. The plants on the patio were mostly wilted. They had one shade up and one shade down, which doesn't sound that bad, but it appeared to me that they were rarely touched. The door leading to the patio had some janky door handle that looked like a bent metal coat hanger. Our silverware was brought out in glass jars as was our check. The kids menu was a 6\" x 3\" piece of card stock that was so full of wrinkles it looked like the previous patron attempted an origami. We were told to get out own drinks. None of this would have been as big of a deal if we purchased a 20.00 meal. And even if it was just 20.00, we still probably wouldn't return. When the waiter came out, he presented a 35.00 check. I thought \"for a turkey sandwich, meatball sandwich, and a small side of noodles?!?!?!\" This was when I noticed that they had all these miscellaneous charges like .45 cucumbers. How about you credit me for the mayo/cheese I didn't receive. I was so irritated for a second I thought about not even tipping especially considering the waiter didn't do anything but bring us the menu, take our order, and take our money. But I realized he shouldn't be penalized for his crappy employer. This place is so overpriced and yet spends very little to convey that they actually care about their patrons. This place is a flippin joke, a rip off, and we will never return here again."

I let house keeping know and she said she would send someone right away. I said that's fine let themselves in.(we were going to the pool)\nThe next thing usually besides checking the bathroom is checking out your view. It wasn't a bad view, the window was just sooo freaking dirty. I don't even know how it could be so dirty as if someone poured something liquid out of a window. So that was aggravating.\n We shortly decided To go to the pool where they tried to charge my guy friend 20 bucks! I don't know if we went to the wrong pool or whAt, but we told them we had a room key and they still said guys are 20 girls are free.\nWe didn't pay, we just walked right in. Why would we pay? We are staying there!\nLater on we go back to the room and the light is STILL flickering. What the heck!? It's been hours! And it's one of the lights that is connected to a couple more, so if that one is off the hallway is very dark. So no light. \nI noticed the phone in the bathroom was dusty, so I started looking around the room and everything was freaking dusty! The nightstand was the most dusty I could write in it. And then, the lamp shade was stained. On BOTH sides. It was disgusting!!!!! I don't even know, I don't even want to know. \nSo I called concierge and I was pretty mad, they said they could send someone up to clean it right away and someone to change the light bulb. Thy told me they could not comp my stay or give me a new room because they were \"booked\". By this time it was later in the evening and I wanted to go out. So I sated forget it I just want 3 free buffets. So we got them and it was delicious! I do love me some buffet. A few days later I noticed they charged me for the freaking buffets. So I called and if course I wanted my money back blah blah. And finally today I received it back. I even wanted to stay an extra night in Vegas, but all they could do was charge me a room for $80. I was like uh no. Not here. \nI specifically made a yelp so I can share my experience here. It's my first review and I will never, ever stay at aria again. Too many issues and even more AFTER I left. \nOh yeah and there was glass on the floor when I went to the buffet. Someone could have definitely \"slipped and fell\". \nYou would think for being a newer hotel it would be a little more clean, but it was actually pretty beat up. Even the elevator buttons are all dinged up. I'm sure people have had great times here. I've seen such good reviews about Aria, but my time was not the best for me."

    "text": "The past week I had been slaving away in the kitchen and I was ready to eat out. I had to run some errands and while driving I saw this big billboard sign for Jack in the Box and I was like, \"Oh Yeah!\" but then I was instantly sad when I didn't see one immediately around. \nNevertheless, I kept driving and I look ahead and I see Jack in the Box. I quickly look over my shoulder and move over 3 lanes and quickly pull into the driveway. No other drivers were hurt, I should mention.\nI was hot and tired, so drive thru it was. I got my two tacos on and they had a special running for the All American Combo for $4.99 so I said why not and went for it. I don't typically purchase burgers from Jack in the Box so I wasn't sure what to expect.\nRandy, that is the name of the fella that serviced me. He was polite, cordial and very friendly. When he asked me if my order on the screen was correct and I told him I couldn't read it, he didn't make me feel bad or give a fuss, he politely repeated my order to me. Then when I get to the window and he takes my payment, he hands me back my card and explains that he is going to close the window on me but my food is being prepared and will be ready momentarily.\nI think my jaw hit the ground. I was completely amazed at his EXCELLENT customer service. You know when you are at the drive thru and you feel like you are more of an inconvenience to the employee rather than a paying customer, or how rude they can be when they just shut the window on you and don't say anything? Randy provided STELLAR customer service. I was so dumbfounded by his most awesome job that I forgot to check my food when he gave it to me. By the time I thought about it, I was already in the street and it was too late. So I said to myself, \"Self, just pray that is right when you get home.\" What I should have said to myself was, \"Self, you know that fella Randy isn't going to mess your order up\".\nSo I get home and guess what... My order was correct and he wasn't stingy with the taco sauce like some places are. He gave me just enough, four packets. These little things matter.\nOnto the food - \nBurger: It contained to big meaty patties, melted cheese, mayo, lettuce ,tomato and I think onion. It was very tasty and I was a fan. This burger ain't no joke. I couldn't even eat half of it. I was stuffed but wanted to keep it eating it.\nMy fries were piping hot (even after my drive home). My tacos were not sloppily made and well, you can't go wrong with a fried taco.\nI am definitely going to go back to this location. I need to see if my first time experience here was a fluke or the real deal. But let me tell you this, I never truly say to myself I need to go back to this fast food place. They are a dime a dozen and a huge corporation so the food will always taste the same but this service stands out above the rest. \nToday, that Randy, he made me fan. \nThanks Jack!"

The inside is really pretty - nice touches to make you feel like you are in a native American dwelling. \nWe started with the 3 sisters salsas and chips. OMG the chips were all homemade and delicious - there was a warm bread/soft taco and then the tortilla chips. The salsas were all really good and interesting. Each one had a different flavors and the portions were huge - easily enough for 4 people.\nI ordered the BLT with house salad. The dressing was delicious I seriously would have bought some if they bottled it. The sandwich was huge! Slices on avocado and huge strips of bacon, what more could you ask for?\nThis was one of the best meals I've had in Arizona and I'd go back in a heart beat."

A large Kobe Burger fan.\nI started my night here, on the dazzling patio, infront of a fireplace, with the game playing on an overheard plasma screen.\nI was lounging back against the cushioned seats, a pillow providing the ultimate in comfort on each side of me. And I held a \"Jalisco flower\" (hornitos anejo tequila, grapefruit, st.Germaine elderdlower, sparkling wine) in hand.\nThen my entree arrived. A gorgeous, succulent, flavorful Kobe burger with Parmesan truffle fries, and blue cheese fondue to dip it in. My tastebuds, my heart, my very soul, melted as I took that first bite. I was in love by the time I dipped my first fry into the divine bleu cheese fondue.\nI don't regret my decision to eat a burger this night. Despite the melange of fabulous and priced to pain steaks such as midwest prime beef, all natural American raised beef, and many seafood entrees. It was one of the best I had savored in the valley.\nFor the discerning beef eater, there is a featured heart brand akaushi filet for $78, or snake river farms qagyu rib eye for $62. Seafood specialties include maple bacon glazed Scottish salmon, miso glazed Chilean sea bass, and day boat scallops.\nA la carte sides include mascarpone creamed corn, cauliflower gratin, roasted brussel sprouts, sweet potato purée with burnt marshallows, baked potatoes, and classic man n cheese.\nMy burger was more than enough to satisfy my cravings, but so overjoyed that I had the sweet potato puree. It was like thanksgiving around a campfire, with s'mores.\nAnd if it had not been for my most wonderful dinner partner, I never would have sampled the Incredible lobster chowder. A seafood party in my mouth.\nThis definitely goes on my list of places to impress your palate, and/or your date.\nTo note: Perhaps the modern steak craze will die down once it has worn off its nouveau, but currently the place is packed to the rafters with diners, drinkers, and singles on the weekends. Reservations are a must, four stomachs an even larger imperative."

    "text": "Easy 5 Stars\nI think everything what makes this place hum and purr like a well oiled machine has already been written. So I won't be rehashing a bunch of issues ya'll should know. I'm gonna stick with three things. The craft cocktails, the steak and the vibe. \nHip and Sexy\nThe lounge here is a throwback in time circa 1970. I love this $hit man. Where Bartenders are Mixologists and the Old Fashion is king. Our Mixologist was Greg. Hip looking dude with his billy goat beard. He makes my wife a Cadillac Old Fashion and me a Flew the Coop. Both drinks are outstanding but I want more. I ask Greg to make me something special. His eyes light up and he says, I've been working on this drink that uses spicy pear liquor and bourbon. My reply, I'll take one. So and true mixologist form Greg breaks out his little black book that he has probably written down more ideas for drinks that you can shake a stick too. So I watch him and he's like a mad scientist with a Billy goat beard muddling a sugar cube soaked in bitters. Then he puts in alittle of this alittle of that and gives it a sample. Then back to work as he adds some apple cider beer and rims the glass with a lemon peel and presto, he hands me his drink. I said what's the name? His reply, he doesn't have one yet. I take a sip and this baby is smooth. Tastes like a beautiful fall day in a glass. The pear, the apple, the bitters, the sugar and the bourbon were fucking excellent. I told Jeff that the name of this drink is Greg's Fall Back or GFB. In honor of the time clocks being pushed back an hour in the fall (extra hour of sleep) this would be a perfect name for such a tasty libation. He said he liked the name and would keep it. hooray!\nHmmmm Steak.\nI am a far cry from a fancy well to do guy. I'm not a lobbyist, politician, or a slick salesperson, I'm a regular dude. One thing is for sure this regular dude knows his steak. It's not rocket science to tell a great steak from a shitty one or if it's cook right or not. Fuck man it's common sense. The 8 ounce filet I got here was money. Served up \"old style\" on a sizzling metal platter. I ordered it medium. I cut right down the center of this bad boy to see if the chef got my temp right. Bingo, perfect. Perfect pink center and just awesome to look at. Now the taste. Meat. Yes I said it. It taste like meat. WTF does that mean? I want my steak to taste like meat not some doctored up sauce ladled, marinaded piece of turd. Let me taste the meat flavor baby. My steak had IT. I would say they used a seasoned salt and just pepper when cooking this bad boy. I don't think they used a plain salt. One word, delicious.\nVibe\nWe walked in they the lounge and it looks like time stopped around 1972. Don't get me wrong nothing was old or tattered. It was a perfectly restored lounge from the 70's. I kept waiting for Marsha Brady to walk in. That scored high points with me. From the paneling, to the booths to the lighting fixtures this place oozed hip and yes I'm fucking sexy. The same theme runs thru the restaurant with the dark woods with almost a 70s hunting lodge feel in the dining room we ate in. Very cool and I was impressed.\nVerdict\nI asked the Yelpers of Madison to help a vacationing brother out where to get a great steak and they did. I can't thank you enough and that's why I love Yelp. Remember to tell Greg the mixologist ( you are not a bartender) that Dan from Ft. Lauderdale sent you for his Greg's Fall Back or GFB and Stay Hungry!"

But when the average price that I could see on the shelf was over $100...that's pricey.\nWhat amazed me most, though, was the customer service. The associate helping us gave us our space, but regularly checked in.

There is a small bar. Also, there is seating al frasco, too. In one corner, there is a round table for a cozy get-together.\nThe service is pretty good- the staff is nice and friendly. The atmosphere is nice. It's a little small (but there is also seating at the Bar, and al fresco, too). The pizza is pretty good- thin crust, good sauce, good cheese. My husband & I shared a pie (had leftovers). I think, maybe, my husband (who is half Italian) thought it was good, but not spectacular. At the time, the baby wasn't eating too many solids, so we didn't share our meal with him. Funny story: the baby was having his bottle and he ended up falling asleep at the table, in the highchair.\n \nAbout the Menu, choose the item and size- personal, small, large (pizza, calzone) and then select your toppings (which takes up half the menu- meats, veggies, extra sauce, basil, garlic, etc.). If you get any starters, it's several choices of salads. Also has desserts, cold drinks, and wine & beer.\nI'm curious about the calzones. I could order it for pickup.

The goat cheese added an extra creaminess to the yolk and I could definitely pick up on some truffle salt that was super delicious. \nFor my entrée, after debating between the filet and lamb burger, I went for the lamb burger. I was feeling extra hungry and naughty.\nThe lamb patty itself was delicious. I really enjoyed the melted feta on top, but found it to be a bit overpowering. To be honest, I was expecting a larger burger, and found myself craving more. And I am one of those people that hates super large portions. I did not think there was enough meat to the burger. The fries it came with were very tasty but not out of the ordinary.\nI tasted my dad's filet and it was delicious, but again, on the small side. \nFor dessert, we split the chocolate pecan pie tartlets. They were so cute and tiny...served warm. Very good. Would have been even better with a scoop of vanilla. \nI have to say that my cocktail was excellent: The Final Fig with Topo vodka, Cointreau, fig syrup and lemon. Very strong, but sweet and yummy!

    "text": "Wetlands Trail is a small trail within the Lake Mead National Recreation Area. It is located on North Shore Drive between the Lake Mead Parkway (Nevada Route 564) and Lake Mead Boulevard (Nevada Route 147) Fee Stations ($10). The gravelly parking lot is just off the windy hilly section east of Lake Las Vegas\n The leading Wetlands Trail segment travels on a bluff. A canyon dominates the landscape. Within the canyon is the rushing waters of the Las Vegas Wash bound for Lake Mead. A few hundred footsteps further, the Wetlands Trail ascends downhill. The trail surface is loose gravel requiring some \"be in the moment focus.\" Straight ahead is the rushing water, treated sewage water I might add. Rushing water is rare in the desert. Where else can you see rushing water in the Mojave Desert? The only place I know of is in Desert Wetlands Park on the other side of Lake Las Vegas. Nature has control here. The vegetation has grown to the point that it is impossible to walk the Wetlands Trail to Lake Mead. There is no spellbinding scenery of rushing water feeding into Lake Mead. On the small segment of scenery overlooking rushing water, quality takes over quantity. The sound of the rushing water and bird chirps with the aroma of the water is just as suitable for a meditation session as hiking. Passing the downhill segment, the trail proper is to the left. A few hundred footsteps further to the left is a canyon. The Wetlands Trail travels uphill through the canyon to the parking lot. \n The Wetlands Trail hike requires some improvisation. On my hike, I went past the canyon turn off a short distance and followed the rocky topography along the Las Vegas Wash. After passing through a cut in the cattails, there is a few hundred feet of shoreline until nature takes over. After the downhill segment, you could walk toward the east border of Lake Las Vegas under the North Shore Bridge. I do warn that the obnoxious graffiti could spoil the scenery.\n The Wetlands Trail displays scenery that is one component of a major ecosystem that is interrupted by a man-made lake. To appreciate the Wetlands Trail, on a cool day, I highly recommend walking along the Wetlands Park segment of the Las Vegas Wash to Lake Las Vegas. You will see that Lake Las Vegas made the Las Vegas Wash a discontinuous natural eco system. The Wetlands Trail is a continuation of the rushing water and natural landscape of Wetlands Park that is interrupted by Lake Las Vegas.\n******Did this hike on Saturday, June 2, 2012."

Case in point . . . he makes his own starch! I've been going to Rave for the past year, and hands down, they are the best cleaners I have ever used. Their knowledge and expertise regarding the cleaning process and their attention to detail is extraordinary. My garments look better than new when I pick them up. You will pay more than your average cleaners here, but if you're a stickler for quality, it's worth it."

    "text": "4 Stars: Got what I was looking for\n2 Stars: Initial service. \n3 Star Average\nThis is probably one of the smallest Best Buys that I've been to. I visited this specific location about 4 times in the last 6 months and each time I got what I was looking for. Since I got what I needed, I have to at least give them 4 stars. However, their service here is lacking a bit. Not lacking in terms of no employees around. But lacking meaning no one willing to help. It's like a silent sale here. No one initiates service, you have to seek it. \nI arrived this evening looking for a pair of purple Beats for my daughter. I know my way around a Best Buy so I walked straight to where the headphones are located and didn't find exactly what I was looking for. I see an employee helping two customers in the area, but noticed they were talking more personal stuff. Not a big deal. I enjoy the occasional small talk with people too. Plus, that's good service to strike a conversation, right? Well as soon as their conversation ended, the employee walked away. He didn't even ask if I needed any assistance. I normally wouldn't be irritated, but I think it was obvious I couldn't find what I was looking for because I was checking every peg for the purple Beats. So I had to do what a lot of these other Yelpers did, look for an employee. Wasn't an problem finding anyone because employees were everywhere. Coincidentally, there wasn't a single employee assisting a customer. \nI finally found someone and not sure if they can tell that I was irritated, but one came to my help. I think her name was Brandi, but wasn't sure because she didn't have a name tag. I just remember names. What I was looking for wasn't on the floor so she checked her computer to verify if they had any in the back. They had some in the back and looks like she went out of her way to locate the item. Good save by Brandi and I ended up leaving with what I wanted. \nWill I come back? I am not quitting Best Buy for anyone, not even bad service. However, I may drive out of my way to another Best Buy."

If somebody asked a question, he had an equally smart ass remark.\nDuring the shooting portion of the training, he was totally condescending towards everybody, although he did shut the fuck up with me when he saw all 15 of my bullseye shots!!\n \nThere was one guy who actually wanted to slash his tires after the course but reconsidered because of all the surveillance cameras at the joint. THAT would have been funny.\nIf I ever see his name again for a training class, I'll be sure to skip it and attend elsewhere."

I selected this place because I've been here before for hair and nails and the atmopshere is very nice and relaxing and the staff and personnel have also been enjoyable. Sadly, they were all booked up for manis or pedis, so I could only get us 3 gals for a 1hr massage... bummer.\nThe facility inside is a nice, welcoming, calm, relaxing space; note however that during massage sessions, you can hear a LOT of chit-chat and noises because it seems the massage rooms have thin walls and no signage outside that reminds staff to keep it down. It makes it harder to relax.\nMassage personnel varied a lot in experience. The gal I got assigned to looked not even a day over 18. She was a bit awkward with massage movments and generally seemed very inexperienced and not very comfortable with her job. My other two guests commented how their therapists were amazing and seemed very experienced and thorough. I know next time to ask for a more experienced gal.\nPrices were very reasonable ($55 for 50 min) and front desk staff and therapists were friendly; Facility is modern and relaxing and not snobby or pretentious, so it's very comfortable.\nI would return here for other spa treatments.. but honestly, for my massages, I'll stick to my gal at LaVida.."

My one major beef with the place right now are the spotlights you sit under while getting your hair cut. While in the chair there is an annoying spotlight overhead shining directly in your eyes. Don't get me wrong - I want the stylist to be able to see what they are doing - but this always makes the experience there less than relaxing. My eyes always hurt by the end b/c it's so bright, and I often end up with a headache. You'd think the light could just shine straight down or could be more diffuse or something. I love the scalp massages and usually end up with a haircut I like, but that spotlight is making me seriously consider going somewhere else."

I was cautiously optimistic about eating here because I know these kinds of places can be hit or miss, but we had a nice time. \nThere was a pretty long line outside waiting for tables (both dining room and bar) but it went by fast. We sat in the bar area to have the Happy Hour specials. $6 apps, $5 sangrias, $3 bottled beer. \nThe Food: We got the pretzel sticks, pretty yummy, I think they were fried, which is different than I am used to, but I still liked them. Potato skins were yummy, good sized and there were a ton of them. Loaded skillet chip nachos were delicious, loved the cheese. \nThe Drinks: Raspberry Sangria, pretty sweet, definitely needed food to help balance it out, but I enjoyed it. \nThe Service: Everyone from the hostess to the waitress was very nice. Waitress was very attentive and checked up on us several times.\nOverall a good dinner experience and a place I would certainly choose over a Chilis or Applebees."

Both times were different experience and both were amazing.\nOn my first visit with my friend, there was a pretty big line (I might be exaggerating, the line was maybe 10 minutes), so we decided to use the pick-up counter and eat in a nearby park. We both had sandwiches in chapattis and both we super good (I can say without a doubt that mine was, my friend said his was too). I was looking for something refreshing and fresh, and that was exactly what I got.\nOn my second visit, we got a seat inside. The waiters were very kind and the service was fast. My girlfriend and I both ordered the dragon bowl (a nice bowl of veggies with rice) and a shake (I got bombay banana). The dragon bowl was so delicious and the shake was super flavorful. We had been walking around in the heat all day (and had some sugary stuff earlier) and we just wanted something fresh and healthy. The dragon bowls delivered! Plus it came to 40$ (before tip) for the both of us!\nI highly recommend this place to anyone who wants something fresh and delicious."

    "text": "Wow!!! This past Saturday, on a whim, my family and some friends decided to go \"venture\" out to go on the Dolly Steamboat Dinner Cruise. Now at first I didn't want to go, thinking that it would be boring or an old-person kinda thing (sorry older folks), but I must say I was extremely pleasantly surprised. \nThe drive into Canyon Lake is and was breath-taking, surrounded by mountains on all sides, greenery, flowers, and then as you come over the last turn, you see the lake surrounded by the mountains -- it's so surreal, it's one of those \"pinch me, I must be dreaming\" kind of moments. \nWe arrived and parked, and since we got there a bit early, we were able to enjoy the scenery from on the dock, which is gorgeous! When we were finally able to check in, we were a bit skeptical about sitting outside since it was still quite warm out, but we were assured we would love it -- and we did!!! I'm pretty sure we had the BEST seats in the house (aside from the captain, of course)! It was so peaceful and serene, and the temperature was perfect (actually even got a bit chilly as we were coming back). \nI have to say, the crew on the Dolly Steamboat -- Jeff (our Captain), Heather, and John -- definitely made our experience unforgettable! They were lively, bubbly, personable, friendly, and cracked jokes which made the cruise that much more fun. Our Captain, Jeff, made sure to point out the Bighorn Sheep (which was really a neat sight to see!), the vultures, shared interesting facts about the cruise itself, explained the caves, and told us other interesting facts as we cruised along. Heather and John were other crew members on the cruise that made it amazing! Our group pretty much made them our personal photographers since we took as many photos as we could before our cameras died, but they didn't seem to mind. \nThen came dinner... and OMGoodness was it amazing!!! I didn't think the food would be all that good but wow! The chefs cooked up some chicken (the most juicy piece of chicken I've EVER had in my life), pork (I don't eat pork but it looked and smelled divine), grilled veggies, and roasted potatoes, complete with salad first and dinner rolls. The food was soooo good that I ended up going back for seconds (after the crew members told us there was enough to go back for seconds if we wanted to... yes, I was totally being a fatty and eating as if it was my last meal). And then, just as I thought I couldn't possibly fit anymore food in my belly, Heather and John told us they were going to bring out dessert -- delicious blackberry cheesecake (so yummy, my mouth is watering just thinking about it). I sure didn't pass on the dessert... and it was well worth almost being rolled off the cruise for eating so much. \nWe arrived back at the dock after dark which was great as we were able to see all the stars come out and could even see the Milky Way since it was so dark. The entire evening was perfect -- thank you Dolly Steamboat crew!!! The only thing I would've changed about the dinner cruise would've been to have my man with me and share the experience with him as well... But now that I know, I'll just have to surprise him and take him on a dinner cruise. It's definitely worth the money and the experience is unforgettable!!!"

The waiter was friendly and the manager came out and talked to us for a long time and even brought us some mac and cheese on the house! Good service always equals a returning customer with me and I was impressed that they took the time to make you feel welcomed and happy. \nThe mac and cheese was outstanding. It was rich and creamy and the cheese had just enough flavor YUM! The shoestring fries were also very tasty. The meats here are very delicious. They are slow cooked and tender as can be.\nThe barbeque itself was pretty good. It is kind of a tangy sweet flavor that wasn't the best barbeque I've had, but still pretty tasty.\nIf you drive past this spot on the highway make sure you stop in and pick up some delicious food!"

The burritos are huge but it really drives me crazy how segmented they are. One bite will be all rice, the next will be all meat. The tofu tacos are okay, but the bean sprouts seem like a weird addition.\nI know, you're probably thinking \"What DOES this girl like about Mad Mex?\" If you can let go of any previous Mexican food experiences (or if you've never had Mexican food before, as I hadn't when I first went to Mad Mex), some things are ok. The tofu tacos minus the bean sprouts. The California grilled salad. The chickpea chili and black bean soup, the potato taquitos. Nachos, chips & salsa, and guacamole are all decent. Their sides are ridiculously huge and the desserts are all ok (except the sopapillas). Basically, stick to the least authentic stuff and you should be fine.\nAdditionally, some of their entrees are available with your choice of either chicken, steak, shrimp, portobello mushrooms or tofu. They have tons of vegetarian options. They have good happy hour deals and good late night margarita deals. They have raspberry, strawberry, mango, and kiwi margaritas year round, with one or two seasonal flavors per month, plus a full bar, a bunch of tequilas and a huge, varied beer list that tends to focus on local beers.\nSo basically: the less you know about Mexican food, the less disappointed you will be.

I used to be quite a regular here, so much that the waitress already knew what I was going to order and she welcome me with a glass of lilikoi as I walked thru the door. \nToday's visit was quite the contrary; as I walked thru the door the older lady turned her back to us but I simply went straight to an open table. A few minutes passed as we waited and another couple walked in thru the door, the older lady was delivering food to a table and she stood there to have a 6 minute conversation with the table (I was looking at my watch) not giving any aloha's that we were going on almost a 15 minute wait and that there was customers standing at the entrance. \nAfter the long conversation, the older lady decided to sit down the couple and hand them some menus. My mom had to get up and ask the older lady for some menus after she sat back down the phone rang and she totally forgot about us. The younger waitress that's always there came out from the back and I calmly asked her for menus for a second time - let me just state that there was only two other tables that were already eating, the place was not packed for such lack of customer service! - still no menus came! The older lady walked to the back twice more and brought the table next to us a to go box and even decided to take the couple's order that had walked in after us. \nFinally! She decided to bring us the menus. I ordered a lilikoi and my mom a sprite, the older lady looked at my mom like she was dumb! She turned to me and tapped my menu with her hand and asked what my mom had said like she was non existent and she didn't know what Sprite is AND to tap my menu as I was reading demanding to know what she wanted!!! How freaking rude??? Apparently, they don't carry Sprite but Sierra Mist. Either way she could of said that, my mom looked at her like ok? where are your drinks on the menu? She snatched the menu off my mom's hand and turned it to the back but that menu was missing the back page! She didn't even apologize! \nMy blood was boiling at this point. I opened the menu and realized that the ahi poke I'm a regular for is now $18 from the $8.95 it used to be! If you can't afford an item on the menu, take it off don't double the price. The price was modified with a piece of tape. I about had it so I grabbed my keys and we walked out the door made me lose my appetite!"

Le choix de drinks est meilleur que dans n'importe quel « resort » du Sud (mais il manque la plage, bien sûr ;) ) et les assiettes sont copieuses et variées. Ça coûte cher, mais faut bien se laisser aller de temps à autre. C'est presque impossible de s'ennuyer à cet endroit (à moins d'être complètement éteint, à mon avis)."

It was just small expensive plates, and LA style service (read: they don't care).\nOnly issues I had were they wouldn't substitute out the foie gras. I agree that it should be illegal to serve tortured animals, so I tried to get something other than foie gras atop my appetizer. No substitutions. Fine, I get it. Secondly, they kept wheeling dirty dishes around the restaurant. Strange, and unappealing. \nBeef Wellington was hella expensive ($275) and took forever. Over 45 minutes from when we ordered. It would be fine if this place were conducive to dinner conversation, but it's louder than STK, but without the ambiance. \nIt's an experience. But it's different for the sake of being different. Super expensive. Sadly, I doubt they have many repeat diners."

My partner and I rolled into town on the Amtrak from Penn Station, which was quite the train ride might I add, and when we came to experience Montreal for the first time, Hotel 10 was our first stop.\nFrom the moment we stepped out of the taxi and into the lobby, there was an ambiance of coolness and luxury that I was dying to have after a long day on the train.\nThe woman at the front desk, a well dressed brunette whose politeness is completely noteworthy, greeted us and chatted a bit with us about how Montreal is always hustling, and even on a Sunday night (about 9pm when we checked in), we could easily walk outside and find some fun.\nWhen we went into our room, I was very happy with the accomodations. We were on the third floor, and it was just a beautiful room to spend three nights in. The bathroom was gorgeous, I loved the shower!\nThe room was great, and the music in the elevators (Daft Punk's new hit) was awesome, too.\nThe breakfasts were delicious, I can still taste the croissaints and cheese plate spread. My favorite person was the jolly and upbeat Montrealer, whose given me the epitome of how I think of native Montrealers, who served us every morning for breakfast. He was so cordial and amusing. We were elated with his service.\nThe best part, I would say, is the location. Hotel 10 is fabulously located and close to EVERYTHING. We twice ran up Mount Royal from our hotel, and went downtown and to the old harbor and Chinatown as well. \nNext time we return to Montreal, I predict we would use Hotel 10 again."

The staff and volunteers at the DBG do an excellent job of directing guests through the garden. Between the well-lit paths (with Luminarias of course), helpful staff and amazing acts, this is an event not to be missed! I consider this to be the ultimate activity for adults. It's romantic if you're on a date, it's festive if you're with your family and it's just pure fun if you're with friends. \nYou enter the park to be immediately greeted by hundreds of meowganificant Luminarias lighting up the entire garden. Cocktail stations lie in every knook and cranny and they serve delicious festive drinks like my favorite, hot cocoa and raspberry vodka! If you're hungry, they sell food throughout the garden at two locations. Then there are the performers. The DBG does an amazing job of bringing in musicians of every shape and size. Whether it's a trio of Christmas carolers, a mariachi band or a lively Jazz band, they have bands in every corner lighting up the night! I am also continuously impressed with the acoustics of the garden. With so many live acts in one area, you can barely hear a specific act until you are in that area. Their event planners did an amazing job! \nLuminarias is my favorite Arizona activity during the holidays and I can't wait to go back next year!!"

Although the place calls itself a cafe, it sits on that grey line between cafe and restaurant... or even diner for that matter. I've never stood inline at a cafe before, except for certain Barstucks where I would stand like an idiot waiting for a seat because a bunch of jerks decided a cafe would be a great place to sit with a laptop all day. Just so happened that these geniuses found there way to Cafe Ellefsen this particular Sunday. I don't see this being a problem now, but once the word gets out about their food, I would see it causing a conflict between turning tables and people nursing a herbal tea. In any case, with a refined and concise menu, this spot is a great choice for a light meal that's a little bit out of the ordinary."

And waiting all this time to find it made it that even more interesting to learn and hear about the history of these signs. \nFinding the building to meet at before the tour was quick and easy to find. Driving up to the Reed Whipple Cultural Center you pass the Bone Yard and don't even notice it. ( I wonder if the people that live behind the bone yard even know its there).Having a few min to spare before our tour started the guide was helpful on letting us know where the bathroom was. He had mentioned to me that they were going to cross the street. \nWe ended up taking the next tour and I was very happy. Justin our tour guide was very informative about the history of the signs and other interesting facts about Las Vegas. I was very amazed by the oldest sign they had in the yard that dated back to 1931. It was very simple but in great shape for being over 7 decades old. If your a photographer or some one who ejoyes rich history and bold contrast for a photographs this is a defiant place for you to experience. \nForm my understanding you can go to Fremont st and check out some sign that the had fixed up and rehung them so you could enjoy the beautiful warm glow of the neon light."

I'm a vegetarian, and this may be the reason I would have never considered going into this place, until I discovered (via Yelp) that they have a veggie burger on their menu. I order my veggie burger with pepper jack cheese, and two slices of grilled pineapple, and it is delicious. By the way, hands down, The Chuck Box has the best fries in Tempe.\nNow, there are a couple of reasons why I'm giving The Chuck Box four stars instead of five: 1) They only take cash, no cards, and this is a little frustrating in 2009. There is an ATM in the place, but of course there is a fee for taking cash out, so you can add $2.50 to the cost of your lunch, which can kill the cost-effectiveness of eating at this place. 2) This place can get really busy and the ordering system is abrasive, i.e. the cook yelling at people to take their order. Now, some people probably love this system, because it creates a unique atmosphere, but I just find it kind of nerve-racking.\nA side note for vegetarians: If you have a problem with your food being cooked on grill that has had meat products cooked on it, where your veggie burger is in close proximity to meat on the grill, you will probably have a problem eating here."

Allegro is someplace that they have been too few times during their stay this trip so why not. It was the first time for me. \nTalk about great service and even better memory from the hostess. Like mention before my friends been here couple times already. So as soon as we were getting seated she mention remember the name and just something hardly see restaurant takes notice of repeat customers. Overall our waiter was very attentive giving us time too order knowing that we were more about conversation then eating. Never empty glass of beer or mixed drink the whole time. We went just for appetizers and drinks. Not problem. The menu is your standard Italian fare high end strip $$. I let my friends order since they been here few times. We got the beef carpaccio and meatball pizza. The beef carpaccio was nice. It was refreshing too see carpaccio not about bunch of stuff under or topped off. It was simple just shaved parm, nice wild mushroom of some sort, and seasonings on top. One that with each bite can taste majority beef just the accent of the toppings. The pizza very thin crust style pizza or could call it new york style. I liked the meatballs nice flavor, moist, and juicy on the inside cooked properly. The tomato sauce felt like could have had more flavor. Overall would say solid pizza but thin crust style had better at other restaurants. The bread basket like the assortment. \nAllegro definitely has your upscale Wynn feeling too it. The chairs really comfortable and talk about heavy. It takes effort too push your chair in more less when your about too leave. seriously. Thankfully its open kitchen because nothing inside terms of decor that really makes it stand out. \nI feel better Italian high end places on the strip or outside the strip. I would be open too going back trying more of the menu."

The veggie kabobs were good. Not greasy, just grilled pure veggies, although maybe a little oregano or seasoning would've been nice. The Greek salad had nothing Greek about it other than two olives perched on top. It's supposed to come with feta cheese but mine was absent. Oh well, still I appreciated the healthy aspect that it wasn't smothered in dressing and instead there is a squeeze bottle of dressing you can add yourself. The braised beans seemed quite oily, but they were tasty so I polished those off. I liked the hibiscus iced tea as well. My friend ordered a chicken pita, plain, which she seemed to like.\nI wouldn't say I'd crave this meal again, but overall if you are looking for healthy food that is relatively fast and inexpensive this is worth trying.

In the end we waited longer on our drinks than our food, but we noticed folks around us, had a much longer wait for their food - guess we got lucky, but I know if I had been them I would have been mad since we were seated after them and got finished eating before their food had even arrived. Anyway..I had the monkey pancakes as wanted to try something different and had read good things about them and my partner had chocolate chip pancakes. I have to say, both were just OK. We have both had better breakfasts elsewhere in Scottsdale, for less money too. So we left unsure what all the hype was about and a little disappointed.

Instead we received dishes that ranged from OK to awful. \nWe started with Escargot on mushroom caps in garlic butter and New England clam chowder. The clam chowder was a thin bland soup with a goodly supply of clams. The Escargot was chewy in a butter sauce with just a hint of garlic. \nMy Atlantic Halibut was fishy, dry and hard. After confirming my opinion with my table mates I sent it back. Overcooking Escargot and Halibut at a seafood restaurant should be considered fatal errors. My wife and granddaughter had Crab Cakes and Scallops which they judged just OK. Not good enough for almost $80.00 in (2) entrees. To the restaurant's credit, the Halibut was taken off my bill without asking. \nThe restaurant is literally in a cellar. As the air conditioner cycles, the environment alternates between clammy and freezing. \nWe had a cocktail waitress (I haven't seen one of those in many years) which is code for over-priced soft drinks in a small glass with no refills. \nThe Food Network has a show, Restaurant Impossible, in which the host, Robert Irvine, visits failing restaurants and fixes their problems.

Going to the Las Vegas Premium Outlets North cut the trek in half and gave me a reason to explore this beautiful side of town.\nMy sister and I thought that we had outsmarted the regular rush but there was still a wait on a Wednesday afternoon. It makes sense since Babycakes can only seat 50 people and has a total of 10-15 tables depending on how they breakdown the seating. \nThe place is quaint. The hostess/cashier saw us come in and placed us on the list without us having to approach her. Fifteen minutes later we were sat. It took another ten minutes and a few puzzled glances to get a waitress over to take our drink order. Once we were noticed, the service improved. \nBetween the two of us we shared the lemon ricotta crepe/pancakes and the adobo fried rice. There were three thin cakes, dusted with powder sugar with butter, lemon wedges,maple syrup, and more powder sugar on the side. The crepes were crisp. The traditional lemon and sugar combination was nice. We did not taste the ricotta though. I wished it was thinly layered on each instead of mixed into the batter. My Filipino friends will probably scold me for getting such an easily made dish, but the adobo was decent. It was more salty than sour or sweet, but balanced well with the omelet wrapped around it. Not being a big fan of mayo, we subbed the mac salad for house potatoes. They were seasoned well, but could have been more brown. For both meals, we left satisfied for less than eighteen dollars before tip."

The dining room is small but they have a terrasse for added seating in the summer time. I'd recommend a reservation just to play it safe since it is becoming fairly well known.

I ordered the eggs benedict with smoked salmon and spinach. The hollandaise sauce was a bit on the salty side but overall it was quite good and they didn't skimp on the smoked salmon. I also loved the way they seasoned the potatoes that came with the dish. They smelled good and tasted even better!\nThe service was very efficient and friendly and in all I enjoyed my experience here. I would definitely like to go back to try the lunch and dinner menu.

    "text": "I can't help but feel that the foodies who love this place only do so with a kind of hipster irony. \nWhen ordering at Merry-Ann's, \"Occam's razor\" applies: go with the simple choices. See a particular dish on the menu that you'd consider ordering? First, imagine yourself cooking it at home...now count all of the potential steps where poor decision-making or lack of skill could result in disaster. Choose the dish where there is little room for error and you're set.\nOn my first, misguided visit to Merry-Ann's, my youthful enthusiasm (and naivete) led me to order the Mexican omelet. What was I expecting? Maybe an egg-licious concoction with chorizo and peppers. Instead I got something akin to a burrito with scoops of taco meat, where the thin skin of egg acted as a wrap. I openly and unashamedly admit that I am a snob in this regard--due to early childhood trauma involving Taco Bell, I simply refuse to consume oily ground beef cooked with packets of \"Mexican-flavored\" seasonings. The meal didn't make it far past \"Go\" before it had to take a few steps back... Err.\nWith that experience behind me, I still gladly stop by Merry-Ann's, but now I stick with those simple dishes, like eggs, breakfast meat, and hash browns. All the breakfast combination plates are pretty reasonably priced and the serving sizes are more than adequate. I don't recommend the dinner items (remember Occam's razor?).\nThe overall ambiance of the place is above average. Compared to campus-town's IHOP, Merry-Ann's is bright and clean. The kitchen isn't in a separate room, which allows you to observe that a good deal of the food items are microwaved. Maybe those people who have food industry experience wouldn't be surprised or bothered, but most places aren't quite so brazen about the nature of food preparation.\nFor standard breakfasts, Merry-Ann's is a solid choice, especially as it's the only real 24-hour game in town and within easy walking distance of all the downtown bars. Still, I'd recommend keeping your expectations low."

It was almost the sensation I had with Matt's Big Breakfast that \"how good can a ham sandwich be?\" but then they surprise you utterly and pleasantly. \nThe principal difference between here and a place like Matt's is bang for your buck. The food is very good at Country Glazed Ham but you don't feel like you're getting away with a steal like at some of the hole in the wall gems around. \nIt is cozy and accommodating and never hard to find a good seat.

It's often enough, but mostly present for ordering. The menu is the \"right\" size. It has noodles, curries, and fried rice dishes without overloading you. This is a stark contrast to so many other Thai restaurants making menus as large as possible. I think they understand what their customers ask for at Archi's. They've certainly shown it works by opening so many locations.\nNow, the food. Archi's is the absolute king of noodle dishes in Vegas. They have my favorite Pad Thai out of any Thai restaurant I've been to ever. The intensity of the sauce is simply unmatched. I also enjoy their pad see ew, but Pad Thai is always my first choice. The portions are also colossal. You simply can't leave without a full stomach.\nAs for everything else, you can find better elsewhere. Their curries are a rip-off. Full of bamboo shoots for the most part and nothing else. Fried rice is simply fine and without any qualities a good fried rice should have: salty, oily, and distinct savory flavor. The spicy basil is strong in basil flavor, but small in portion. The spicy eggplant is a bit oversauced but otherwise good.\nNoteworthy: lunch specials. They're a great deal particularly if you dine in. You'll get your item, an egg roll, a side salad, soup, and a little... dough.. thing I can't explain. Great deal, great price. Weekdays only.\nFor Thai-style noodle cravings, there is simply no better choice from my experience. For everything else, you can surely find alternatives."

The reason I am giving this a low score is because too much of the show was Celine singing song from other artists, versus her own hits. Maybe she is tired of singing those songs or wants to pay homage to the artists that inspired her. But I paid top dollar because I wanted to hear HER hits - and left disappointed. \nSo disappointed in fact that I didn't bother to stop in the gift store to purchase souvenirs like I usually do when I am on an emotional high after leaving a concert that makes me feel good. \nYes her singing is stellar - she could sing the yellow pages and it would SOUND good but would you want to hear that? And far too many of the songs she covered were slow, somber, even a bit depressing - (Janis Ian's at 17 for example). Not really the mood I want to be in while in Vegas. Great production, poor playlist. \nThere was a segment where she subjected us to home movies of her kids, which I might have enjoyed if she sang a cover song that she is noted for such as \"The first time ever I saw your face.\" But instead she picked the slowest, least known song by Billy Joel. ( I am a Billy Joel fan and had never heard that song).\nI wish I had seen her when she did her A New Day concert which appeared to be much more upbeat. \nAlso there is a beautiful mannequin of Celine Dion inside and it would have been great to take a photo beside it and put on my facebook page.

Anyways to start with, this downtown location is always busy, so try to reserve earlier on if you can. Now I don't know about you but I'm usually on the cranky side when I am already hungry for breakfast and not have a coffee fix yet. So breakfast places usually have to run an extra mile to get on my happy side. A side tip would definitely be come here with you're caffeine dose on the weekend mornings. I went in with my husband, and waited a good 10 minutes before I got seated. Not a problem, but took an extra 10 minute before the waitress got to us. Even then its okay, its busy, everyone's stressed, someone didnt have their coffee yet, heyy no biggie. What annoyed me to begin with was my seat on the booth was a bit scrapped off. Management should really take a note because I am sure proper seating suits well in a place like that. \nThen the hostess literally just drops the utensils on the table. Gee, thanks. Already annoyed luckily the waitress came to save my day. She was really all I could ask for at the time of and the only reason I gave this review an extra star from 1 to 2. Didnt catch her name, but she was really calm and I felt really relaxed. The drinks were okay. But, the food was a bit weird. I usually always order their pancakes called black jack, which is chocolate chip pancakes with shit tonnes of powdered sugar, whip cream and chocolate. I didnt get my chocolate sauce here, and when I asked the waitress whats up, she told me they usually dont serve the sauce. Before making a scene, she was smart enough to bring me the sauce, after I told her that I have this dish quite often at their brossard location.\nI really wasnt too happy with my experience here. The food wasnt horrible but not as outstanding or anything like the other place I go to. I only appreciated the servers attitude but that too will probably never make me return to this location.

However, whilst dining in Le Mouton Noir, I almost forgot I was in Edinburgh and on glancing out the window, kept expecting to see French architecture. What induced my dream-like state were the French music, French waiters and a French chef producing only French cuisine - no alternative Western options on the menu, although I'm sure they could improvise on request, but why would you want to?!\nThe food: I had a rather unexpectedly large bowl of garlic butter muscles - for being a starter which made me worry about my next course, however I was disappointed I couldn't lick my fingers upon finishing - minding my manners and all. This followed with a perfectly proportioned main of feathered rare steak, chips and salad. I cannot recall a meal where I wanted to savour every single flavour and am grateful to my fellow yelpers for wanting to share their delightful discoveries too. Normally I always make room for pudding and wish I could comment on dessert. The options sounded amazing but on this occasion I resisted temptation based on not wanting to over indulge a fully satisfied belly! Being a Yelp newbie and not that familiar with my table of Yelpers beforehand - I'm not sure whether it was the passion for Le Mouton Noir's fine gastronomy or that the yelpers were all round fine folk that led me to feel a bond. \nMoving on to pricing. Wow! I had a double take, a squint, a rub of my eyes and another squint followed by confirmation from my table that the prices were in fact a lot cheaper than we expected: £12 for the best steak I've ever had - amazing value for money and a purse left with a happy ching ching of change in it. \nLe Mouton Noir is petite with modern and simple décor and a cosy or intimate feel - depending who you are with - therefore suitable for date nights or small groups. \nAlso, my unfamiliarity with French cuisine provoked me to remark at the prominence of meat options on the menu and now that I am better educated will point out that since the French are much about their meat dishes, there were only one or two Veggie options - for whom it concerns.\nI will definitely be returning to my Petite bit of France and maybe learn some of the lingo too!"

Somehow manages to have terrific seafood, despite its landlocked location. \nThis is what a casual fine dining restaurant should be: cozy, dimly lit, excellent but unobtrusive servers, terrific food. Plus I love that they keep some bar seats and tables open for walk-ups. It gets very crowded on the weekends, so I recommend reservations, or going on a weeknight."

Tumbleweed park is already a rather large green space with a recreational center that boasts a pool, some sports fields, and smack dab in the middle is Playtopia. A playground so big, that it has been partitioned into three themes areas: (1) Farm Land, (2) City Land, (3) and Critter Land. Farm Land is the biggest, and offers your typical brightly colored, metal and plastic play structure geared to the five and older crowd. The best part, Farmland has a giant sun shade. City Land has streets for bikes and scooters, smaller play structures for younger tykes, and single rider vehicles that use a spring for locomotion. In Critter Land, you'll find a massive Gila Monster, a giant shell worth exploring, an archaeological dig, some climbing rocks, and the sand box. So, don't forget those rarely used shovels and buckets. There are also swing sets around Playtopia and pavilions of various sizes open for rent. The bathroom is nearby and there are several parking lots around the park. When you can see the giant sun shade near a parking lot, find a space."

It's actually pretty consistent with the other Great Dane locations in Madison. I ordered the Webster Street Salad with a cup of Corn Chowder. \nThe Salad was decent aside for one bite of gristly chicken. The salad was comprised of mixed greens, plenty of dried cranberries, walnuts gorgonzola and cut up bite sized pieces of chicken. \nThe Corn Chowder was tasty albeit the salad alone would have been plenty substantial in terms of filling one up. \nIf you are in the Dane County Airport - this is your only option for a true sit down restaurant. It has a full bar and the service is relatively efficient. They are also open very early if find yourself at the airport for a Zero-Dark-30 flight."

The food service was fast and the food was hot and delicious.\nI ordered the smothered chicken, with macaroni & cheese and greens, and I was in heaven. Even after being smothered in their delicious brown gravy, the fried chicken was crispy, juicy, and cooked to perfection. The macaroni and cheese is made from scratch, you can taste all of the seasonings and cheeses melted into the noodles. Normally I'm a fan of really creamy macaroni and cheese but there was so much flavor to this, I couldn't say a bad thing about it. I loved the greens, they were cooked perfectly and very flavorful. My friend ordered the fried catfish, it was also cooked perfectly, the breading had just enough flavor to give the fish a little kick without overpowering the taste. Her fried okra was also amazing, the coating they use tastes amazing! Unfortunately, neither of us had room for dessert. =(\nOh yeah, and they serve Kool-Aid!"

It little different concept then your traditional plate lunch action with two scoops rice, mac salad, and protein. Yet if you look at the menu notice all the staple local food from katsu, teriyaki chicken or beef, curry, mochiko chicken, and more. Then notice they have few Favorites combinations choose from with all kinds of mix plate goodness. The word Bento brings back all the things I miss about the islands but more so the local food. RIce Trax Teriyaki Grill does a wonderful job of bringing me back for the islands. \nThe differences is the choices of sides not sure if works the same for the Favorites part of the menu. I choose too do the Trax Box (The Boxes) you get too pick two items from list of 14 items. They also offer three item that called words too my heart \"Bento Box\". I went with both teriyaki beef and teriyaki chicken. The sides they have whole list just for that part of the menu. I keep reading reviews for the kimchi fried rice. I was all over it. Not often find local place that can get kimchi fried rice instead of white or brown rice. Not sure if for all items since was my first time but looking around think all the proteins comes on skewers. Another differences that stood out for me. It might make it easier or harder depended on you. Me say fan because like fact that gives the beef and chicken nice grill char mark on the outside. You really taste the teriyaki marinade all the way from the outside and in. Yet both meat nice moist and cooked perfect. The kimchi fried rice was \"Da Bomb\". I could have ordered just bowl of it and be completely content in life. They added diced zucchini and other vegetables make it ever more hearty fried rice. If want leave those things out. The prices are very very reasonable most of the combinations all under ten dollars. It all made fresh too order.\nThe service was excellent. On the way out taking my leftovers and refilling my drink for the road One of the workers notice that could use plastic bag and ask if wanted one. I was fine either way. Just the fact she notice but taking the time too actually help out put it in the bag rather then here a bag. Classy touch.\nThe decor is interesting because it had really high ceilings for such small place and just one artwork. Bold colors orange sure if looking for place too brighten ones day this is it! If need visual comes too the menu they have few of them look at. The outside sign could be bigger.. I passed it once since was my first time. \nI enjoyed my experience and definitely plan on coming back."

I had this place bookmarked for a while, as well as some others, since living with a pizza connoisseur (further known as PC) so check out my other reviews for local pizza joints in the area. \nBreadsticks: 3/5 stars. They were good, but nothing to rush here to get. The dough was really well made; soft and fresh, topped with a generous amount of Parmesan cheese and garlic. I didn't like the amount of butter left on the pan; it seemed wasteful and just looked gross. I also thought it was strange that the pieces weren't really uniform. \nPepperoni pizza: 4/5. A good size for a medium, I think the serving size would be good for 2 alone or 3 with an appetizer or wings. The crust was really good; soft, chewy, and buttery with a slight crunch (if you like that sort of thing). The sauce didn't seem to have an enormous presence, but the toppings were plentiful. We usually order pepperoni pizza (yeah, we're adults- so what?!), and I'm usually pretty disappointed by how sad the pepperoni looks but here they were abundant and tasted great. Cheese was generous and tasted fresh. \nService: (3/5) The service was a little timid. The gentleman as well as the young lady that took care of is during our meal were very soft spoken but kind, and seemed eager to make sure our meal went well.\nOverall, if I lived closer to this place, we'd probably order delivery every now and again, but since Natali's isn't close enough to deliver, I don't think we'll be back unless we were in the area. Although I sometimes question his taste in restaurants, PC didn't seem too impressed with the pizza either."

Maybe it's like the Wendy's breakfast commercial and panini really does mean eggy-bacon-boat...but I digress. So we got the bruschetta and I wanted to pretend like I was 9 and scrape of the toppings and not eat the stale un-toasted bread. But wait - the final piece was toasted and actually warm...and it wasn't that bad. \nI really wanted to like this place - it's a perfect people watching spot on Mill (itself worth the price of a glass of wine).

We sampled delicious cocktails (The Daisy and Autumn in Paris) and amuse trios in the lounge overlooking the fountains. Michelle was our server and she was fantastic. Two managers, Laurent and Ehsan, stopped by to welcome us. It was a phenomenal experience, and my guests loved it so much that they came back to the restaurant for both lunch and dinner later in the week.

Nonetheless, in spite of all the hype and hyperbole, it's a good cupcake. When the Olive Oil Vanilla Cupcakes from the Olive Oil mill are too far away, this becomes the cupcake backup. Especially the vanilla.\nI'd give this place a better review but I don't because I consider the cupcake to be the \"Rodney Dangerfield\" of desserts. Too many far better post meal options come to mind before I'd waste my valuable calorie allotment on a cupcake."

We noticed that every time someone would get up, the waiters would replace their napkin and fold it up all fancy. It got to the point where, just to be obnoxious, we would get up and down and up and down. I think we had almost as many waiters as people in our party."

    "text": "I feel like I'm stepping foot in the Midwest when I come here; everything on the menu, aside from the inexplicable sushi (huh?), is breaded, deep fried and/or smothered in an inch of cheese, and served with a half-cup side of ranch sauce (you don't even have to ask for the ranch, they'll automatically bring it to you).\nBeers are the real draw here. All the ones I tried here - the Hefeweizen, Black Chip Porter, and High Roller Gold, were flavorful and washed down the greasy fare well.\nDecor is surprisingly nice as well. The ornate tin ceiling and the pretty glass enclosure of the beer vats are not overshadowed by people screaming at the TVs that are blaring sports. \nAs many have mentioned, the service is sub-par, but not abysmal. The waitress was there to take our orders and to deliver the food and drinks, that's all I can really say about her. I was at least glad that we didn't have to wait too long, even on Friday night during Memorial Day Weekend. \nAt the end of the day, this place is definitely sports bar esque, but there's certainly nicer trappings as well (microbrews, sushi menu, nice decor)."

Tried the happy hour again to find the chicken nachos much more edible - the chicken is still a bit salty but its on the border of salty and best seasoned chicken ever. The mushroom cap appetizer is delicious, ESPECIALLY with some lemon squeezed on top. The wings off the bar menu were delicious as well - 3 peppers or something, so its a low lingering hot that I do enjoy.\nI think I will definitely come back. Not sure for the pricier food, but the happy hour and apps are definitely much improved."

As we stood outside it looked really busy upstairs, and loud, so we were going to walk on but the bouncer said she would check if we could just go into the restaurant part downstairs which was quieter (they'd stopped serving food by then). They said it was cool for us to go to the downstairs part which was great. It did take us a looooooooong time to get served even though it wasn't busy, and the waitresses were around us cleaning other tables and chatting. Once we got served though the cocktails were good and I liked the water they gave us which had cucumber in it.\nI probably have given this place an extra star because the bouncer was so helpful and I can't really judge the bar upstairs, so I'll have to go back at some point to check this part out as it looks totally different."

Needless to say I'm no ramen connoisseur. On the other hand it was like my eyes were opened to a whole new world. Like the time I realized that there was better anime and that Naruto is really just middle of the road (I had to close the book on that one).\nSo Monta is a nice small little place. you come in and the waitress greets you like she's a character straight out of anime (no I haven't been watching a lot of anime lately . . . maybe). You sit, she gives you the menu, you order and it was on our table in just a couple of minutes! Now that's service. Heck, I may have even flirted with her once or twice in the evening. I can't tell, I watch anime. \nThe place stayed busy throughout but it didn't seem till we were nearly done that there seemed to be any wait time especially considering the quick service.\nNow as for the food itself, my friend recommended the tonkotsu and he deserves a pat on the back for that. The broth was full of flavor. I didn't even need to put the garlic on it but I was just curious if that would taste better was well . . . AND IT DID! The noodles were yummy, the small pieces of pork in it were excellent, and the glass of water refreshing! \nI may not be an expert in ramen but now I'm wishing I can be one. I'm already talking with co-workers about visiting again soon. For such a cheap price, it's both tasty and pretty damn filling. Two thumbs up."

It includes choice of salads, choice of sides, 8 ounce filets, huge crab cake, and choice of desserts! YUM. \nI've been to nearly every steak place in town but had always passed this place up. It's a chain and we have so many awesome steak places here.. why even try it? I found out about the $99 special and that they were associated with my favorite steak chain of all time, Sullivans, and I knew I had to try it. \nThe signature martini is the same one from Sullivans.. a yummy pineapple infused vodka! I adore this martini and it's a delicious way to start your evening. \nOur dinners here were incredible! We are total and completely steak snobs and weren't expecting much, but these steaks were so damn good! SO MUCH better than the steaks I ate at SW Steakhouse just a few weeks ago. If I had to be picky, the mushrooms I picked as my side were bland and boring, but this was a non-issue honestly. I was too focused on my yummy meat! The caesar salad and chocolate mousse were also excellent, as well. \nFor tourists, perhaps you should stick to a more famous steak place on the strip.. but for locals skip the strip and head to this place! We liked it far better than Envy or Twin Creeks or our other locals spots. We will definitely be back to sample the $99 special again this summer!"

As I was driving by, heading to a familiar place, I decided to give it a go and try something different. I was glad I did. It's standard Tex/Mex. The food could use a little more spice, but I assume they are directing their seasoning toward the people who want the Tex/Mex flavor without any zing.\nChips and salsa were completely average. The salsa tasted like it came from a bottle of Pace salsa - nothing special there. For the entree, I had the Pork Rostistado with \"spicy verde sauce\" or so the menu says. The meal came with rice, black beans with some cheese sprinkled on the beans, and some great sauteed vegetables - zucchini and carrots - and the standard container of tortillas. As for the \"spicy verde sauce,\" well it wasn't spicy. The plain black beans had more zing than the verde sauce. I asked my server for some Cholula and the dish took on a spicier flavor, more the way I like it. The pork was very tasty, and in all, it was a good meal.\nOf course, going to a different place means you have to try dessert just to see if the place is on the up and up. I got their Banana Napoleon that was highly recommended by my server. It was layers of banana pudding, sweetened, fried tortilla squares, and fresh bananas and whipped cream. She was right. It was superb, but way too big! OK, I made the sacrifice and finished it so there was no waste of food from me.\nService was excellent. My server was a delightful young woman, very attentive, and she brought me refills of my iced tea promptly and without me having to request it.\nI'll be returning. This is an OK place for what it is, Tex/Mex in a nice atmosphere and a different selection of some menu items."

This probably made me a poor candidate for this gym to begin with, as their hours and classes are limited. Anyway, I visited the gym in April and was impressed with the sales rep, the facility, and the quality of trainers. I had very limited time that day (the story of my life!), so I filled out a little card (I did not complete any membership paperwork) and left to carry on with the day.\nIn May, I began the stressful and lengthy process of home buying and got even busier! David Barton Gym began charging my credit card, and I was fine with that.\nCome June, I'm still absolutely slammed and haven't been able to get to the gym. At this point, I had been getting repeated phone calls from these clowns asking me to come in and fill out the paperwork. With everything I had going on, David Barton Gym wasn't a priority. I was fine with them charging me the membership fee. I had no issues. But what did they do? They threatened me. They started telling me that I would be charged MORE because I hadn't filled out the paperwork...\nLong story short, I decided this wasn't the place for me due to bad customer service and asked them to simply stop charging my card since I had never officially become a member anyway . I didn't ask for any refunds whatsoever. What did they do this time? They refused to stop charging me unless I filled out the membership paperwork. \nHuh? OK...well, long story short again: Silly me capitulated and signed the membership paperwork along with the cancellation paperwork at the same time, again never asking for a refund. However, David Rivera (who is great, by the way - I feel sorry that he works for that company because he deserves better) insisted that I accept a refund for May. That was a nice gesture. I kept telling him it wasn't necessary, but he insisted so I finally accepted.\nFast forward to July. No refund from David Barton for May as promised, and I didn't really care at that point. I had closed on my house and was in the midst of cleaning, preparing, and moving. It had been a CRAZY two months, and the David Barton Gym was the last thing on my mind.\nWhen I finally got a chance to get my files in order after the moving process, I discovered that David Barton Gym had never STOPPED charging my card! I was in possession of cancellation paperwork that indicated no further charges would be made after May, yet I had charges for June and July.\nMaking a long story short for the last time, it's August 14 and I STILL haven't received a penny back. I'm left with the conclusion that this place condones fraud and tries to get away with it whenever possible. The General Manager, Greg Refner, has no customer service skills (and no desire to serve or be fair to people) and certainly no urgency for anything...unless it's getting someone to sign membership paperwork under duress. \nI am really appalled at the way in which this entire debacle was handled. I'd suggest staying away from this place at all costs, no matter how glamorous it may seem."

    "text": "I have noticed the service going downhill on my last several visits. I continually get nail techs that are not very good and take forever. I usually also come here for my pedicures but after the last one I had which was rushed to the point that she hurt me, I won't be going back. I thought I might continue coming in to get my nails done but I am tired to trying to be friendly to techs that are more concerned with getting you in and out than found a good job. I recently went elsewhere for my pedicure and for only a few dollars more I had a terrific experience. That's where I will be going from now on."

The mussel dish was one of the best flavor combinations I have ever experienced. I heard through the grapevine that they carry OMB Copper now, so my next visit will be even better! \nGreat work Good Food!"

    "text": "Awesome hotel if you're here for the convention center; not-so-awesome if you're here for everything else! With that being said, it's off-strip and by the north end of the strip. The plus to this location is that it's a pretty short cab ride to the Wynn/Encore.\nMost of the time, you can get a room here dirt-cheap through one of those last-minute booking apps/sites unless there's a convention going on. I've gotten a room for $31/nt. Dude, that's cheaper than a janky motel to handle yo business!\nThe rooms are decent if you're just looking for a place to crash out and shower. It can get pretty lonely here."

    "text": "This rating is for their bell service only.\n This hotel has been my favorite for the past 6 years. I felt the quality of the rooms, pools and casino made it the best semi-affordable hotel in Vegas. My first trip to Vegas with my fiancee was at this hotel. We always enjoyed the tropical smell when you first enter the lobby. The high ceilings in the casino always made the air seem less smokey than others.\n We decided to get married at their chapel since we had such a great first experience here together.\n We arrived and the bellman unloaded our luggage. The wedding dress and veil were atop the suitcases. He hung the dress and veil on the luggage cart. My fiancee practically jumped out of her skin as he dropped the cases on the long wedding dress and veil pushing them aside. I grabbed the dress offering to carry them myself. He reassured me he would be careful.\n We checked in and were upgraded to a nice roomy suite. The bellman arrived and with 2 hands squeezed and lifted the 3 garment bags and the veil which was in a dry cleaning bag labeled with the name of the dressmaker \" ___'s Bridal \"on a hanger. My fiancee practically fainted after seeing this. As I am telling him that was a wedding veil and please be gentle, he shifts his hands and drops the 3 garment bags. The hanger from the garment bag rips a hole in the outer plastic of the veil. My fiancee is now in tears. She checked the veil as best she could through her tears and didn't see any damage.\n On our wedding day my bride is in the Mandalay Bay Silver Chapel dressing room having her veil placed on her head when her maid of honor and mom start to cry. There was a series of holes right in the front of her face! They had already used most of the 40 minutes before the ceremony to get dressed. Luckily they calmed down enough to come up with a plan. With minutes to go, they put the veil on backwards.\n \n I was wondering why she had a look of terror in her eyes as she entered the chapel. As soon as she saw me, our eyes met and everything seemed to be alright. We had a beautiful ceremony and reception.\n Bell service minus 5 stars. Our favorite hotel plus one star. Memo to bell staff, please be careful with wedding dresses, they mean everything to the bride.\ntl;dr Torn wedding veil, tears, MacGyver fix, married. Carry your wedding dress to the room yourself or risk disaster.\nFollow up: Tosha, after reporting this incident we were told to file a property damage report with security. After filing a report at the security desk in the casino we waited 3 hours in our room for security to take photos of the veil. We were given a $200 credit. After leaving our number, we were told that we will receive a call from a manager. It's been four days since our stay. Although you may be pleased with your own effort, we aren't."
